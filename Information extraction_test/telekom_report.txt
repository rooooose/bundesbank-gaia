"Act responsibly. Enable sustainability." is the title of our 2017 CR 
Report. We chose this title to emphasize our commitment to sustainable 
activity along the entire value chain and to highlight the potential that 
our products and services hold when it comes to addressing environ-
mental, economic and social challenges.
Deutsche Telekom has been involved in CR reporting for more than 20 
years. The CR Report – in addition to the non-financial statement we 
published in the 2017 Annual Report – is our primary medium for 
informing our internal and external stakeholders about our challenges 
and progress as a responsible, sustainable company.
REPORTING PERIOD, SCOPE OF APPLICATION AND TARGET 
GROUPS 
All quantitative information, indicators, and descriptions of key events 
and activities refer to the year 2017. Any deviations are marked accord-
ingly. The 2017 CR Report is a Group report that includes many 
national companies in which Deutsche Telekom holds a majority stake. 
It also follows up on the 2016 CR Report.
This report is specifically addressed to Deutsche Telekom stakeholders. 
These include analysts and investors, CR ranking and rating agencies, 
non-governmental organizations, customers, employees, business part-
ners and representatives from the fields of business, science, research, 
education and politics.
LOOKING BACK ON DEUTSCHE TELEKOM’S CR REPORTING 
Deutsche Telekom has been reporting on its sustainability activities 
in various publications since 1996. From 2003 through 2006 we pub-
lished a combined annual HR and Sustainability Report. An interim 
report issued in 2007 formed the transition to our current CR reporting. 
Since 2008 the Telekom Group has been publishing a comprehensive 
CR Report each year.
OUR ONLINE REPORT: FOCAL POINTS AND CONTEXT 
We have been publishing our CR Report exclusively online since the 
2010/2011 reporting year to meet the requirements and user prefer-
ences of our stakeholders. The online 2017 CR Report has been availa-
ble since April 19, 2018 in German and English. Each of the five main 
sections begins with an introduction and an overview of relevant events 
and developments on that topic. The subsequent pages are structured 
as follows:
 
Sustainability relevance: explains what makes the topic significant to 
sustainable development and to Deutsche Telekom's long-term 
business success. 
 
Management approach: how Deutsche Telekom approaches key 
sustainability topics, what its goals are and how it intends to achieve 
them. 
 
Progress during the reporting period. 
The report also includes information on “CR facts” and specific informa-
tion for investors and rating agencies. This is background information 
on a variety of topics that can be accessed directly from the text via 
links. Readers can also access the "CR facts" section at any time by 
clicking on the footer. A download area, search and dialog functions 
and an interactive benchmarking tool make it even easier to navigate 
the report. What's more, the info cart lets readers select different con-
tent and create a customized PDF file.
This year we are also publishing a CR brochure entitled "DIGITALIZA-
TION – CREATING ENDLESS OPPORTUNITIES". DeutscheTelekom's 
online magazine, "We Care", also offers a range of interactive informa-
tion on important social challenges.
SELECTION OF KEY TOPICS FOR THE 2017 CR REPORT 
To identify the key topics for the report, we conducted a comprehensive 
materiality process. The process is a regular component of our annual 
CR reporting activities that helps us identify the topics with maximum 
relevance for us and our stakeholders.
STRUCTURE OF THE CURRENT ONLINE REPORT
The online 2017 CR Report has been structured as a progress report. 
It focuses on key developments during the reporting period, which are 
discussed in five central reporting sections:
 
Customers and products
 
Society
 
Employees
 
Suppliers
 
Climate and environment
These are complemented by three additional sections:
 
The Strategy and management section describes the management 
of CR processes and the Group-wide integration of Deutsche 
Telekom's CR strategy. 
 
The majority of our national companies whose CR activities are 
described in this report have their own profile page. The profile 
pages can be found under the "National companies" menu option. 
 
In the Indicators section, consolidated and commented indicators 
provide information about our progress in the past few years.

ADDITIONAL SOURCES FOR CR-RELEVANT CONTENT 
In addition to this online 2017 CR Report, we also use the non-financial 
statement published in our Annual Report to provide information on 
how we assume responsibility in society. Further information about our 
current CR activities can be found under the "Responsibility" menu 
option of the Deutsche Telekom website. The national companies pro-
vide information about their CR commitment on their Internet portals 
and in their own publications.
IMPLEMENTATION OF HIGH INTERNATIONAL REPORTING 
STANDARDS 
Deutsche Telekom's 2017 CR Report 2017 complies with the interna-
tionally recognized guidelines (GRI Standards) of the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI). It also serves as a Communication on Progress (CoP) 
from Deutsche Telekom as part of the United Nations Global Compact. 
You can find an overview of specific measures being used to implement 
the Global Compact principles here. Deutsche Telekom also issues an 
annual, detailed Declaration of Conformity with the German Sustainabil-
ity Code.
ASSURANCE ENGAGEMENT
Selected indicators from the 2017 CR Report for Germany and our 
national companies Magyar Telekom (Hungary), Slovak Telekom (Slova-
kia), OTE and Cosmote (Greece) and T-Mobile US were audited as part 
of an assurance engagement by auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers 
(PwC).
In accordance with the GRIStandards, all of the indicators marked in the 
GRI Indexwere audited by an independent auditing firm. The independ-
ent assurance report can be found under the Assurance report menu 
option. All of the audited content in this report is identified with the sym-
bol 
 and will apply unchanged until the next CR report is published.

We are very pleased about being listed in renowned sustainability rank-
ings and ratings and about the numerous awards and certifications we 
have received during the reporting period. Our national companies 
were also recognized for their CR commitment. You can find an over-
view of this on the profile pages of the national companies. We discuss 
our current position in ratings and rankings in the "Strategy and man-
agement" section.

INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE REPORT
INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE REPORT
Independent Practitioner’s Report on a Limited Assurance  
Engagement on Sustainability Information*
To Deutsche Telekom AG, Bonn
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the disclosures 
denoted with in the Corporate Responsibility Report of Deutsche  
Telekom AG, Bonn (hereinafter: “the Company”), for the period from1 
January 2017 to31 December 2017 (hereinafter: “Report”). Our engage-
ment in this context relates solely to the disclosures denoted with the 
symbol .
Responsibilities of the Executive Directors
The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the prepara-
tion of the Report in accordance with the principles stated in the Sus-
tainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (here-
inafter: “GRI-Criteria”) and for the selection of the disclosures to be  
evaluated.
This responsibility of Company’s executive directors includes the selec-
tion and application of appropriate methods of sustainability reporting 
as well as making assumptions and estimates related to individual sus-
tainability disclosures, which are reasonable in the circumstances. Fur-
thermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal con-
trol as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a 
Report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or 
error.
Independence and Quality Control of the Audit img Firm
We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding 
independence as well as other ethical requirements.
Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional 
standards – in particular the Professional Code for German Public Audi-
tors and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für Wirtschaft-
sprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer“: “BS WP/vBP”) as well as the Stand-
ard on Quality Control 1 published by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer 
(Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements to quality 
control for audit firms (IDW Qualitätssicherungsstandard 1: Anforderun-
gen an die Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis - IDW QS 
1) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality con-
trol including documented policies and procedures regarding compli-
ance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements.
Practitioner´s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the 
disclosures denoted with in the Report based on the assurance engage-
ment we have performed.
Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on 
external sources of information or expert opinions, referred to in the 
Report.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the Inter-
national Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): 
Assurance Engagements other than Audits img or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that 
we plan and perform the assurance engagement to allow us to con-
clude with limited assurance that nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the disclosures denoted with in the Company’s 
Report for the period from1 January 2017 to31 December 2017 have 
not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the rele-
vant GRI-Criteria. This does not mean that a separate conclusion is 
expressed on each disclosure so denoted.
In a limited assurance engagement the assurance procedures are less 
in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore a 
substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The assurance proce-
dures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgment.
Within the scope of our assurance engagement, we performed amongst 
others the following assurance procedures and further activities:
 
Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability 
organization and of the stakeholder engagement 
 
Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the Report 
regarding the preparation process, the internal control system relat-
ing to this process and selected disclosures in the Report
 
Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement of the 
Report under consideration of the GRI-Criteria
 
Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in the Report
 
Performance of web conferences and telephone interviews as part 
of the inspection of processes and guidelines for data collection at 
the following locations:
 
Deutsche Telekom AG
 
PASM img GmbH
 
Strabag SE
 
T-Mobile US Inc.
 

consolidated financial statements and in the group management

Assurance Conclusion
Based on the assurance procedures performed and assurance evi-

the period from1 January 2017 to31 December 2017 have not been 
prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the relevant GRI-
Criteria.
Intended Use of the Assurance Report
We issue this report on the basis of the engagement agreed with the 
Company. The assurance engagement has been performed for pur-
poses of the Company and the report is solely intended to inform the 
Company as to the results of the assurance engagement. The report is

Each year, as part of its Corporate Responsibility report, Deutsche  
Telekom publishes a comprehensive declaration of conformity with the 
German Sustainability Code. The German Sustainability Code aims to 
make companies' sustainability performance transparent and compara-
ble under a binding framework.
Deutsche Telekom's declarations of conformity can be viewed here.
The German Sustainability Code was approved by the federal govern-
ment's Council for Sustainable Development. Deutsche Telekom was 
one of the first companies to accede to the Sustainability Code.

Dear Readers,
The year 2017 ended with a real highlight for Deutsche Telekom: In 
December, we received the German Sustainability Award for our holistic 
sustainability management. I am pleased that this award recognizes not 
only our many years of work, but also how we are using the opportuni-
ties offered by digitalization for a better future.
This positive conclusion to the year was important for me. For looking 
back at the year, there was again great cause for concern in 2017:  
persistent armed conflicts forcing people to flee their homeland. Politi-
cal rhetoric exacerbating conflicts rather than defusing them. Burgeon-
ing nationalism focusing on division and not on cooperation. And fatal 
ignorance as regards the consequences of climate change, threatening 
to undo the hard-won progress of recent years.
But anyone who just decides to sit back and do nothing is drawing the 
wrong conclusions. I feel very strongly that standing by our convictions 
has seldom been more important than today. This applies not only to  
us as individuals; it is particularly relevant to Deutsche Telekom as a 
company. The values for which Deutsche Telekom stands must be 
defended. We are a European undertaking, and believe in the European 
vision of shared prosperity and social security. It is not for nothing that 
our brand motto is Life is for sharing. We want to enable sharing 
through digitalization in Europe and beyond. We stand for optimism 
as well, for in order to leave a world worth living for the next generation,  
we must stride into the future with courage and curiosity.
The biggest driver for this is digitalization. It will enable progress in the 
fight against climate change, in medicine and education, creating more 
livable cities and inventing new products for a more sustainable every-
day life. So what is our role as Deutsche Telekom? We are "enablers": 
In this way, we want to make our contribution so that digitalization can 
unleash its full potential for more sustainable development.
We are laying the foundation for this with our investments: Each year,  
we invest more than five billion euros in Germany alone, especially in 
expanding our networks. At 455,000 kilometers, we already operate 
Germany's largest fiber-optic network. But our responsibility does not 
end with providing technical access alone. The key to equal participa-
tion of all in the knowledge and information society is media literacy – 
especially today, in times of fake news, filter bubbles, cyberbullying  
and hate comments. Hence, this is one of the focal points of our social 
commitment.
the question of what corporate responsibility means in the digital age. 
 
Timotheus Höttges, Chairman of the Board of Management, Bonn, Deutschland 
As optimistic as we are, we cannot ignore the fact that some people fear 
negative consequences of digitalization. For this reason, we're exploring 
Within our Group, this means above all strengthening our employees 
to handle change, realigning our skills and promoting lifelong learning. 
Moreover, we want to encourage social debate: via our Group’s "Digital 
Responsibility" portal and together with partners in the "Charter of 
Digital Networking " initiative. Last but not least, it is important to 
strengthen users' trust through consistent commitment to data security 
and data privacy.
Building bridges for a sustainable future is a matter of principle for 
me. With this in mind, I would like to reaffirm our commitment to the 
principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the German 
Sustainability Code.

STRATEGY & MANAGEMENT 
STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
BOARD OF MANAGEMENT

Deutsche Telekom aims to be the leading telecommunications provider 
in Europe. This corporate vision is the basis for our approach as a 
responsible company (CR approach) and our CR mission.
Our Group CR strategy also provides our national companies with a 
framework for their sustainability measures. The central components 
are our three CR action areas. They provide a framework for the focal 
topics of our sustainability management activities.
Our CR program states which specific goals we wish to achieve with 
which measures. We monitor our progress using key performance indi-
cators (KPIs).
An integrated governance structure helps us to closely interlink strate-
gic management and operational implementation of our CR strategy 
throughout the Group. Overall responsibility for sustainability lies with 
the Deutsche Telekom Board of Management.
CURRENT ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
Our Group Corporate Responsibility (GCR) unit is a key driver for 
change within our company. Within the organization, it reports to the 
Chief Human Resources Officer. The duty of the GCR is to further 
develop our corporate culture with a focus on sustainable innovation 
and social responsibility.
Another pillar of our CR governance structure is the HR Leadership 
Team (HR LT). The team is an advisory and decision-making body for 
the Human Resources (HR) Board department. It makes decisions on 
Group-wide policies and guidelines, CR positioning, and the strategic 
focus of the CR department. Members of the HR LT are managers at 
the level below the Chief Human Resources Officer.
In addition, the CR Board, composed of the heads of key Group units, 
supports the CR department when it comes to CR management and 
strategy enhancement.
The CR managers from the different business units and national compa-
nies are responsible for implementing our CR strategy. They collaborate 
intensively within the international CR Manager Network, where they 
coordinate their activities and share best practices.
CR GUIDELINE INTRODUCED AT EUROPEAN NATIONAL  
COMPANIES
Our CR Policy provides the formal, mandatory framework for the 
sustainability management activities at all Group units. We introduced 
the policy at Group Headquarters, Telekom Deutschland and T-Systems 
back in 2014 and at the majority of the European national companies 
(in the fixed-line and mobile communications area) at the end of 2017. 
The USA plans to adopt a CR Policy in 2018.

BE SMARTER! - NEW SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY 2016 - 2020  
AT MAGYAR TELEKOM
Magyar Telekom aims to make sustainability an integral part of our  
business. We therefore developed a new sustainability strategy for the 
period from 2016 to 2020 that was influenced by the expectations of 
responsible investors, EU directives, industrial and corporate trends, 
local conditions, and consumption patterns. Climate protection, educa-
tion, and digitally enabled sustainability will be the major focus of the 
strategy until 2020. Our strategy continues to remain valid and no major 
update was therefore needed.
Climate Protection – Our goal is to help our customers become climate 
conscious. Our ambitious objective is to generate revenue from our 
climate protection activities while at the same time reducing our actual 
CO2 emissions below 100,000 metric tons. This enables us to enhance 
our activities directed toward decreasing emissions and specifically 
build on our “green” services.
Education – Our goal is to directly or indirectly reach 100,000 people 
in Hungary through our training program by 2020 with the objective of 
educating the public and our customers. We are focusing primarily on 
programs aimed at eliminating the digital gap and expanding the suc-
cession pool in industry.
Digitally enabled Sustainability – As a sustainable digital company, 
Magyar Telekom enables its customers to use sustainable digital ser-
vices. We strive to pursue responsible marketing and activities that 
enable and inspire others. Awareness in the public domain of Magyar 
Telekom as a sustainable company is projected to reach 50 percent.
CERTIFIED HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL  
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM: ALMOST ALL WORKPLACES COVERED
We want to make sustainability a component of all our business pro-
cesses and of our employees' everyday lives. Our integrated health, 
safety and environmental (HSE) management system assists with this 
at the Group level. The management system helps us systematically to 
plan, implement and improve our HSE processes. This promotes the 
health of our employees and has a positive effect on their performance. 
It is also beneficial when it comes to bidding on new projects, since an 
increasing number of potential customers now require their suppliers 
to provide HSE certificates.
Our Group-level HSE management system is covered by an umbrella 
certificate based on the international standards OHSAS 18001 for 
occupational health and safety and ISO 14001 for environmental 
management. For some units, it also covers international standard ISO 
90001 for quality management. Some of the national companies are 
not covered by an umbrella certificate because they have their own cer-
tifications which are, in part, even more comprehensive. This is the case 
in Greece, for example. This national company has an integrated man-
agement system, which in addition to the above-mentioned standards, 
also covers the international standards ISO 50001 for energy manage-
ment and ISO 27001 for data security. Telekom Deutschland also has 
an environmental certification.
Through our compliance with legal regulations, we already meet the 
essential requirements for OHSAS 18001 certification in Germany. All 
employees in Germany and 99 percent of employees outside of Ger-
many are employed at an OHSAS 18001-certified workplace. Some 
93 percent of employees in Germany are employed at an ISO 
14001-certified workplace. Internationally, we are at 83 percent cover-
age. Our goal is to cover all companies that have more than 50 employ-
ees by the end of 2018. Furthermore, we have additional certificates 
outside of Germany for our health, safety and environmental manage-
ment systems, with which we cover 99 percent of our international 
employees.
ACHIEVING MORE TOGETHER: INTERNATIONAL  
COLLABORATION
How can international corporations put sustainability strategies into 
practice across borders? Deutsche Telekom employs CR managers for 
the relevant business segments and national companies to reach this 
goal. Through the CR Manager Network, CR managers attend regular 
face-to-face and online meetings to share best practices and discuss 
new challenges, thereby jointly promoting essential CR issues. The 
central Group Corporate Responsibility (GCR) department is responsi-
ble for managing the network.
Since the 17th CR manager meeting in May 2017 in Bucharest, topics 
have been increasingly discussed in workshops, which our international 
colleagues help shape. The workshops lead to working groups and 
regular online meetings in order to jointly promote key topics.
The 18th CR manager meeting took place on November 15 in Bonn 
within the framework of the UN Climate Conference. It was connected 
to the event "The Impact of ICT on climate change – curse or blessing", 
which was hosted by GCR.
GERMANY'S MOST SUSTAINABLE LARGE COMPANY 2017
For its uniform sustainability management, Deutsche Telekom won the 
German Sustainability Award in December of 2017.
The jury commended Deutsche Telekom's pioneering role, stating: 
Deutsche Telekom AG is setting the bar with its sustainable supplier 
management, enabling massive energy savings for its customers with 
its core operations and itself contributing to more energy efficient data 
transmission with various measures.
2017 CR PROGRAM
As part of its CR program, Deutsche Telekom specifies targets to be 
implemented throughout the Group in the relevant processes of its core 
business.
The CR program defines specific measures and a timeline for imple-
mentation. We also provide information on the implementation status of 
various goals in the CR program. Detailed information on the ESG KPIs, 
which we use to quantify our performance in each area, is provided in 
the CR Report.

Deutsche Telekom's CR Controlling department plays a key role in con-
trolling our CR activities. Controlling has been supported by an IT-based 
data collection system for the past eight years. The system makes sure 
that ESG (environmental, social and governance) data and KPIs are 
promptly and transparently recorded and reported. It supports stand-
ardized, mandatory processes at the Group and national level and ena-
bles Group-wide benchmarks. This IT support lets us focus on content 
analysis of ESG data and helps us measure early on in the process to 
what extent we have reached our CR targets and if we need to make 
changes.
We especially use ESG data to calculate our ESGKPIs, with which we 
measure and control our CR performance throughout the Group. CR 
Controlling is also responsible for recording other performance indica-
tors with sustainability relevance. These are published in the perfor-
mance indicator section as well as in the CR report's interactive bench-
marking tool.
We further defined the focus of the CR Controlling department in 2017 
by refining the KPI system for controlling based on internal and external 
requirements:
 
We incorporated two new ESG KPIs in 2017 for measuring our pro-
gress in creating a more sustainable supply chain: the CR-Qualified 
Top 200 Suppliers ESG KPI and the CDP Supply Chain Coverage 
ESG KPI. 
 
Suppliers who fulfill our strict sustainability criteriaare included in 
our CR-Qualified TOP 200 Suppliers list. This list contains 200 sup-
pliers who were qualified based on our criteria. They receive prefer-
ential treatment when we award projects. The new CR-Qualified Top 
200 Suppliers ESG KPI shows how many of these suppliers under-
went a risk assessment in the past year. 
 
The CDP Supply Chain Coverage ESG KPI measured the percent-
age of procurement volume from emission-intensive suppliers who 
took part in the CDP Supply Chain Program in 2017. The number 
was 66 percent. Our goal is to cover 70 percent of our procurement 
volume with suppliers who take part in the CDP Supply Chain  
Program. 
 
The ESG KPI Energy Consumption and the ESG KPI CO2 Emissions 
have no longer been reported since 2017. After a transition phase 
in 2016, these were entirely replaced by the Energy Intensity ESG 
KPI and the Carbon Intensity ESG KPI. 
 
We also adopted the Social Innovation ESG KPI in 2017. We use this 
KPI to record the number of downloads of our mobile app "Sea Hero 
Quest", which was developed to fight dementia. We now thus have 
another indicator for measuring ICT's contribution to solving social 
challenges, in addition to the Enablement Factor ESG KPI. 
 
We use the PUE value, among other things, to ascertain the energy 
efficiency of our network infrastructure. Due to its high relevance, 
the PUE value is for the first time also mentioned in the Indicators 
section of this CR report as a KPI with a target value.
 
Impact measurement is another topic of focus for our CR Controlling 
department. Our aim is to continuously improve and quantify the contri-
butions made by our business activities to solving social challenges. 
This chapter describes the current project status and results on the top-
ics "Broadband expansion", "Media literacy" and "Contribution to human 
rights".
ESG KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
ESG KPIs (key performance indicators) are used as management tools 
for our CR involvement. They enable us to improve our performance on 
an ongoing basis. As they are relevant to our supply chain, we also 
address them in our Annual Report.
We use 13 KPIs that are valid Group-wide to manage our CR perfor-
mance:
 
Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) ESG KPI
 
Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI
 
Sustainable Revenue Share ESG KPI
 
Energy Intensity ESG KPI
 
Carbon Intensity ESG KPI
 
Renewable Energies ESG KPI
 
PUE ESG KPI

Enablement Factor ESG KPI
 
Used Cell-Phone Collection ESG KPI
 
Community Investment ESG KPI
 
Beneficiaries ESG KPI
 
Media Literacy ESG KPI
 
Employee Identification with CR Commitment ESG KPI
 
All of Deutsche Telekom's national companies that participate in the CR 
data collection process are obligated to record our Group-wide ESG 
KPIs. These national companies represent 99 percent of the Group's net 
revenue.

ESG KPIs cover types of capital
For the purpose of integrated financial and sustainability reporting, 
the KPIs map the six types of capital addressed in these reports and 
therefore also reflect the essential aspects of the sustainable value of 
our company (see diagram).

IMPACT MEASUREMENT AND MANAGEMENT
Our goal is to strengthen our foundation for conscious business 
decisions and continuously improve the social impact of our products, 
solutions and measures. That is why we illustrate the contributions 
made by our business activities to solving social challenges in the 
"impact measurement" focal point of our Controlling department. 
This way we also fulfill the expectations of our external stakeholders.
We evaluate various methods and select suitable approaches per topic 
for the impact measurement. We make sure that the selected methods 
and assumptions are traceable, are based on solid data and are valid 
for several years. The topic of impact measurement is not entirely new to 
us. We have been employing business impact measurement in strategic 
action areas since 2015. Based on the Total Impact Measurement and 
Management (TIMM) framework developed by PwC, we have begun to 
methodically document and financially assess the results of our busi-
ness activities on the environment, society and the economy.
To ensure transparency and comparability of the results, we use conven-
tional external frameworks to describe the effects of our contributions. 
Some examples of this are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 
and the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the 
National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights and the UK Mod-
ern Slavery Act. Furthermore, in addition to the perspective of our inter-
nal stakeholders, we also take into account the external stakeholder 
groups, such as the investment company RobecoSAM, which assesses 
companies in issues of sustainability. We also participate in cross-secto-
ral committees on impact measurement, such as the econsense initia-
tive or GSMA, which represents the mobile communications industry. In 
2017 our CR managers and experts attended a workshop together with 
the German Institute for Development Evaluation (DEval) to discuss cur-
rent scientific methods as well as approaches and focal points for 
Deutsche Telekom.
After we analyzed our impact in the broadband expansion and media 
literacy areas in 2015, we selected human rights as the next topic for a 
more in-depth impact measurement. We have already seen initial results 
during the reporting year, which we describe in the Our contribution to 
respect for human rights section. These two approaches are described 
in more detail in the drop downs below.
In the coming years, we want to broaden our focus and, in addition to 
examining the social impact of our activities, also take a closer look at 
the positive effects of our products and services and other strategic 
focal points.
IMPACT MEASUREMENT: RESULTS OF THE BROADBAND 
EXPANSION AND MEDIA LITERACY PROJECTS
In 2015 we conducted an exemplary analysis, based on strategic core 
topics, of the social contribution that we made with products (Broad-
band Expansion) and services (Media Literacy). We made sure that the 
underlying methodology could also be transferred to subsequent years.
Broadband expansion
Deutsche Telekom has a strong positive effect on society thanks to its 
broadband expansion activities and is helping achieve the UN's sustain-
ability goals. The company's network expansion is creating new jobs, 
STRATEGY & MANAGEMENT 
CR CONTROLLING AND IMPACT MEASUREMENT

and hence new income. It is also facilitating access to digital services, 
such as those in the health care sector. Improved network coverage 
therefore especially benefits people in urban areas and smaller towns. 
The quantitative analysis shows that more than 50 percent of our expen-
ditures for network expansion went to construction (civil engineering). 
This sector hence benefits most from our investments. The analysis also 
showed that for every million euros that we invest in broadband expan-
sion, about 20 new jobs are created along the entire value chain, most 
of which in the German construction industry.
Media literacy
We analyzed the Teachtoday initiative in the strategic topic area of 
media literacy. This initiative contains an online platform as well as 
competitions and conferences on media use by children and teenagers. 
A positive social effect is also evidenced here. That is because the 
learning methods employed with Teachtoday appeal to multiple senses. 
According to PwC's results, such methods are more than twice as effec-
tive as learning methods that only appeal to one sense. In line with the 
TIMM framework, we also use the so-called educational function for 
analyzing the value contribution. The analysis shows that for every euro 
we invest in media literacy measures, the Social Return on Investment is 
more than two euros. This means that society benefits twice from our 
expenditures on specific media literacy measures.
IMPACT MEASUREMENT: OUR CONTRIBUTION TO RESPECT 
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
Due to the ever-increasing importance of the topic among our custom-
ers and in society in general, we focused our impact measurement on 
human rights in 2017. We examined not only our own companies but 
our partners along the supply chain as well.
We began identifying the important effects of our human rights commit-
ment during the reporting period. Some of the issues we examined 
were salaries and benefits, working hours regulations, continuing edu-
cation as well as maintaining a high standard of health protection, diver-
sity, integrity, compliance and environmental protection. In developing 
and newly industrialized countries, the focus of our activities is on 
improving working and living conditions, fighting discrimination and 
forced labor and helping promote respect for human rights.
Our commitment to human rights is not limited to our role as a responsi-
ble employer in our international subsidiaries. We also pursue a partner-
ship-based approach to supplier management. We regularly verify the 
effect of our activities by means of human rights impact assessments, 
employee relations policy reviews and on-site inspections at our suppli-
ers' place of business.
Everyone involved benefits from our commitment to protecting the 
rights of workers – even in the business respect. That's because better 
working conditions have a positive effect on employee satisfaction, 
loyalty and motivation and decrease the staff churn rate, thereby 
increasing productivity and improving product quality.
We will further specify the above-mentioned interdependencies in 2018. 
We will then integrate the results into our strategic orientation, including 
suitable metrics and reports, if possible.

Corporate responsibility (CR) is based on shared values. To solidify our 
value-based corporate culture, we convey the basic values of our com-
pany to all employees through binding Guiding Principles. We use vari-
ous measures such as the annual "Guiding Principles Day" to remind 
employees of these values again and again, entrenching them in our 
everyday work. And the measures have been successful. According to 
our pulse survey in November 2017, 77 percent of our employees 
believe that the Guiding Principles are applied to our everyday work. 
The approval rating has therefore continued to remain at the same high 
level as in 2016.
Our Code of Conduct and our Code of Human Rights & Social Princi-
ples (formerly: Social Charter) are other tools that we use to ensure that 
our Group and our partners show corporate responsibility in their con-
duct. Our compliance management system, which makes sure that our 
business activities are in compliance with laws and regulations, is based 
on these documents. 
PROUD TO BE T – OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES DAY
In September 2017 we held our eighth International Guiding Principles 
Day throughout the Group. The Guiding Principles were introduced in 
2009 with the objective of defining a common system of values for all 
Deutsche Telekom employees worldwide. This year the focus was not 
on one individual Guiding Principle. Instead, every employee worldwide 
was asked to reflect what we can be proud of at Deutschen Telekom. 
Under the motto "Proud to be T", all employees could upload short 
videos to the internal Telekom social network and share their personal 
"pride stories" prior to Guiding Principles Day. A contribution was made 
to a charitable organization for each shared video.
On the actual Guiding Principles Day, work pride was a much-discussed 
topic throughout the entire day and a montage of the video contribu-
tions was shown. In addition to a central event in the foyer of Deutsche 
Telekom Headquarters in Bonn, there were keynote speeches about 
what we can be proud of as Deutsche Telekom. The event's opening 
was transmitted live, while the individual keynote speeches were 
recorded for later viewing. In addition to the many different team activi-
ties, central international activities also took place, all in connection with 
the event's motto.
In total, more than 30 interactive keynote speeches took place world-
wide. In addition, more than 200 videos were uploaded, thanks to which 
EUR 7 500 were donated to the Deutschland Hilft (Germany Helps) 
action group.
COMMITMENT TO THE GERMAN "CODE OF RESPONSIBLE 
CONDUCT FOR BUSINESS"
We were among the first to sign the German Code of Responsible 
Conduct for Business, which was presented to the public in November 
2010. All of the members of our Board of Management signed the code, 
making an express commitment to responsible corporate governance 
in line with the principles of the social market economy, to fair competi-
tion, cooperation with employee representatives, business excellence 
and sustainability. We have incorporated this commitment into our 
actions and have assumed a leading role in putting our commitment 
into practice.
In the spirit of the code, we feel obligated to engage in sustainable 
business practices and responsible corporate governance for the 
good of the people. We are continuously working to ensure that these 
requirements are implemented in our core business and our supply 
chain. In addition, we take responsibility for our employees and our 
social environment. We work to guarantee respect for human rights 
without exception.
We use our products and services to connect people and to increase 
the productivity of many processes. In this way, we help ensure that 
Germany and Europe can continue to make strides in international com-
petition and that our well-being can continue to grow. Our smart digital 
solutions are creating new ways to effectively address social challenges 
such as climate change. Our goal is to simplify our lives for the long 
term. Our network helps us implement this broad social mission by 
acting as a lifeline: fast, reliable, secure and easily accessible to every-
one. Just like all of our activities, these efforts are focused on people. 
We provide transparent information on our plans and technologies, 
engage in fair practices and are always open to dialog.

In line with the code, we continue to expand our leading position as 
a sustainable company as well as our ongoing efforts to optimize our 
value-added processes. To do so, for instance, we are increasing the 
energy and resource efficiency of our networks, services and products. 
In this way we are reducing the environmental impact and CO2emis-
sions produced by our business activities. In 2014 our Board of Man-
agement approved a Group-wide climate protection target for 2020. 
Building on this work, we have been implementing an integrated cli-
mate strategy since 2015. We also offer our customers sustainable 
products and services and encourage our over 30,000 suppliers to do 
business with an equal focus on sustainability. To assist this process, 
we engage in various activities such as a systematic supplier develop-
ment program and complete audits and training measures. We also 
train our buyers on sustainability criteria in procurement. In these efforts 
– just like in everything we do involving our diverse stakeholders – 
we primarily rely on partnership and dialog.
As a responsible employer, we see an opportunity in digitalization to 
continue to improve employee cooperation. Our future work concept 
explains our vision of the working world of the future. The concept 
makes room for virtual collaboration and other new ways of working. 
Digital learning and working methods are also part of the future stand-
ard. Employees can enroll in our Massive Open Online Courses 
(MOOCs) or continue their education with learning games and short 
learning units when they are on the road. In 2017 more than 30 percent 
of all learning hours at our company were completed in digital form, a 
number we hope to increase to 60 percent in 2020. Our working world 
has also become more appealing in the spatial sense. We successfully 
completed our reconstruction activities at the Group headquarters in 
Bonn and at the Hamburg and Frankfurt locations in 2017.
We want our employees to have their say at our company – regardless 
of their position in the corporate hierarchy – and promote an active 
feedback culture to this end. We use the advantages of digitalization for 
this as well; for example, with our social network YAM, which has about 
115,000 users Group-wide. Our employees can not only obtain compre-
hensive information on YAM but can also engage in cross-hierarchical 
dialog and raise topics that are important to them for discussion within 
the Group. Another key element of our feedback culture is our Group-
wide employee survey.
Digitalization not only affects cooperation but our employees' health 
as well. We started a three-year joint project with BARMER in 2017 that 
examines how corporate health management will have to change in a 
digital working world of the future.
Our social commitment, however, is not just to our customers, partners 
and employees. We feel it is our responsibility to support the develop-
ment of media literacy in our community. Our efforts in this area include 
the Teachtoday initiative, which promotes safe and competent media 
use. For example, around 120 children discussed the topic of data pri-
vacy at our 2017 Summit for Kids. We also redesigned our website 
www.medienabersicher.de in 2017, where we present our activities for 
increasing media literacy and protecting minors.
All our efforts regarding CR were rewarded in 2017, when we were 
named the winner of the German Sustainability Award in the Large 
Enterprises category.

Companies that rely on sustainable business practices are more com-
petitive in the long term. Analysts from Deutsche Asset & Wealth Man-
agement and researchers at the University of Hamburg collaborated to 
analyze more than 2,000 studies on the topic. Their conclusion: The 
business case for sustainability has a sound empirical basis, and the 
vast majority of the studies analyzed pointed to a positive relationship 
between sustainability and financial performance. This is why investors 
who are interested in sustainability tend to focus on long-term yields 
instead of short-term profit. Socially responsible investment (SRI) can 
be an important component when it comes to securing capital for 
Deutsche Telekom AG in the long term.
Our contribution to the SDGs
SRI investment products consist of securities from companies that have 
passed an audit conducted in accordance with environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) criteria. This is why the development of demand 
for T-Shares from socially responsible investors serves as an indicator 
for assessing our sustainability performance. With our Socially Respon-
sible Investment ESG KPI we measure how the financial markets per-
ceive our CR activities. Investors concerned with sustainability often 
refer to ratings published by specialized SRI analysts. For this reason 
the rating given to our company by SRI analysts has an impact on our 
ability to win over and retain socially responsible investors and achieve 
our goal of keeping our company's medium and long-term cost of 
capital at a low level.
An increasing number of investors are responding favorably to the 
concept behind the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
This is especially true with regard to the future orientation of the SDGs. 
It appeals to investors who are interested in companies engaging in 
more transparent reporting on their long-term strategic orientation and 
prioritization. In order to measure and quantify the effects of our activi-
ties, we started an Impact Measurement pilot project in 2017. This way 
we want to make our contribution to achieving the SDGs transparent.
We use different formats – both in our reporting as well as in direct 
dialog – to inform SRI analysts and investors of our CR activities. More 
and more investors and rating agencies are interested in receiving infor-
mation on our CR activities. Investors not classified as SRI investors, like 
Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Société Générale and HSBC are beginning 
to organize SRI conferences as well. Deutsche Telekom is regularly 
invited to present our CR strategy and commitment as best practice at 
these conferences. 
INVESTOR COMMUNICATION
We have been publishing important Deutsche Telekom ESG KPIs in our 
Annual Report for several years. Financial market players interested in 
sustainability can also review ESG information in the Socially Responsi-
ble Investment (SRI) section on our investor relations portal. Interested 
parties can find additional information on these topics in the CR rating 
info boxes provided as a supplement to this CR report.
In addition to our reporting activities, we also engage in targeted dialog 
with investors. For example, the CR and Investor Relations (IR) depart-
ments jointly held several Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) road-
shows, for instance in France and the USA, at which we offered to 
answer critical questions from our investors. We also held conference 
calls to keep interested investors informed and responded to numerous 
direct requests for information. In addition, we attended SRI confer-
ences, organized conference calls and web conferences, and answered 
numerous direct queries from rating agencies, analysts and investors.
We covered the entire spectrum of ESG criteria: governance structure, 
data protection and data security, corporate responsibility controlling, 
sustainable supply chain, human rights, climate protection and busi-
ness impact measurement.
CURRENT POSITION IN RANKINGS AND RATINGS
Deutsche Telekom's ESG (environmental, social and governance) per-
formance is assessed within the scope of CR ratings, which provide 
investors with valuable information for their investment decisions.
As in previous years, the T-Share was again listed in leading sustainabil-
ity indexes such as the DJSI World and the DJSI Europe Index from 
RobecoSAM in 2017. In addition, the rating agency oekom once again 
singled us out as the world's best telecommunications company in 
terms of ecological and social performance. We qualified for the A list of 
internationally leading companies in the CDP climate protection ranking 
for the second time in 2017. CDP commends companies that report 
their CO2 emissions in an extremely transparent and detailed manner. 
In addition to making it onto the A list, we were also included in the 
STOXX Global Climate Change Leaders Index. We were also listed in 
the STOXX Global ESG Leaders Index for the seventh year in a row – 
as well as in the iSTOXX SD KPI since 2017. Once again, our share was 
listed in the FTSE4Good index and the UN Global Compact 100 index 
in the reporting year. We were deemed to be an investible stock by the 
Fair World Fund for the first time in 2017. The Fund focuses on the topic 
of "development, international fairness and sustainability". At the begin-
ning of 2018 we were also named one of the most ethical companies 
worldwide by Ethisphere, an institute that promotes ethical business 
methods. We are the only German company among the 135 com-
mended companies.
COMBINED NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT IN THE ANNUAL 
REPORT
In 2014 the European Parliament and the EU member states adopted a 
directive that expands the reporting obligations of large, capital-market-
oriented companies. The CSR Directive obligates such companies to

report on important non-financial aspects, such as environmental, social 
and employee concerns as well as protection of human rights and com-
bating corruption and bribery. Germany enacted this directive as 
national law in 2017 under the CSR Directive Implementation Act.
Deutsche Telekom's combined non-financial statement is contained in 
the management report of the 2017 Annual Report.
TAX POLICY GUIDELINES
The Group Tax department is responsible for ensuring that the 
Deutsche Telekom AG Group pays taxes and duties at the national and 
international level in accordance with the applicable statutory provi-
sions.Group Tax makes sure that the Deutsche Telekom Group com-
plies with all its tax obligations in Germany and abroad, in particular that 
it pays the taxes in accordance with the local laws and regulations appli-
cable to the individual Group entities. This includes the Group's income 
taxes, which must also be regularly reported in our IFRS financial state-
ments, as well as VAT and income tax on salaries payable within the 
context of customer transactions and for Group employees. Group Tax 
also ensures that the corporation has an efficient tax structure within the 
framework of German and foreign tax law as applicable in each country, 
i.e., that the Group does not carry any unnecessary tax burden. The goal 
is to achieve sustainable tax efficiency for the Group, something in 
which transparent, reliable cooperation with local tax authorities is 
deemed to be indispensable.
In addition, Group Tax also has the ambition to contribute as much as 
possible to the success of Deutsche Telekom's operations, e.g., by pro-
viding detailed tax advice regarding new business models or innovative 
technological developments. In such matters, the department is particu-
larly focused on immediately clarifying any unresolved tax law-related 
issues as well as providing practical solutions to meeting all applicable 
tax requirements.
The tax strategy – Tax Compliance, Sustainable Tax Efficiency, Tax as 
Valued Business Partner – was also adopted by the Deutsche Telekom 
Board of Management.
SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR 
DEUTSCHE TELEKOM PENSION FUNDS
We are fully committed to sustainable finance. Correspondingly, we also 
apply our sustainability principles to the assets of the Telekom Pension 
Fund. We have pursued a sustainable investment strategy for the selec-
tion of these capital assets since 2013. In addition to financial aspects, 
we also take into account ecological and social principles as well as 
guidelines for good corporate governance.
In 2017 we refined our investment strategy. We specified the list of 
negative criteria we employ and added to it best-in-class strategies and 
approaches to commitment. Accordingly, excluded from investment are 
companies that manufacture or do business with so-called controversial 
weapons (for example, anti-personnel mines, cluster ammunition, 
nuclear weapons, biological or chemical weapons). Also prohibited are 
investments in companies that have repeatedly violated the principles 
of the UN Global Compact.
We have also defined a best-in-class approach. Our investment manag-
ers select companies that boast the best sustainability performance in 
their respective sectors in which to invest. A decision was also made 
to effectively support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as 
shareholders with voting rights (shareholder engagement).
The investment managers will be selected based on their expertise in 
ESG issues. With this approach we aim to align attractive expected 
returns and sustainable value orientation with each other. By investing 
in stable values, we want to fulfill our fiduciary responsibility to our 
employees regarding capital investment. Our goal is also to avoid 
reputation risks and larger risks of loss.

The member states of the United Nations (UN) adopted the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015. The Agenda's aim is to 
enable economic development and prosperity – in line with social jus-
tice and while taking into account the ecological limits of global eco-
nomic growth. The Agenda applies equally to all nations of the world. 
All emerging and developing economies as well as industrial nations 
should play their part.
The core of the 2030 Agenda comprises 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs). They officially went into effect in January 2016. The 
SDGs cover all three dimensions of sustainable development – social, 
environmental and economic – for the first time. Politicians, civil society 
and the business community must cooperate closely in order to achieve 
these ambitious goals. As such, companies are also called upon to 
make concrete contributions.
Deutsche Telekom has accepted this task and emphatically supports 
the Sustainable Development Goals. Many of our products, services, 
and activities that we present in this section already allow us to make 
such a contribution. 
OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
GOALS
Information and communication technology (ICT) has the potential to 
help achieve the SDGs. This was the result of a study conducted in July 
2017 by the International Telecommunication Union, a special agency 
of the United Nations. When used correctly, ICT can accelerate innova-
tion and change, thereby supporting sustainable development.
We want to utilize this potential. Our network infrastructure offers the 
technological foundation for diverse and innovative approaches for 
solving social and ecological challenges - and hence also for achieving 
many SDGs. That's why we believe we can make the biggest impact on 
SDG 9: "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable 
industrialization and foster innovation."
The following chart illustrates the “enablement-effect” of our business 
activities: Our network infrastructure as well as our products and ser-
vices lay the foundation for contributions to further Sustainable Devel-
opment Goals, in particular to number 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 12, 13 und 15.
As a responsible employer (SDG 8), we greatly value employee partici-
pation and a working environment that is fair and respectful; we encour-
age diversity and support our employees on their journey toward the 
digital working world. Furthermore, many of our products, services and 
activities make a concrete contribution to achieving additional SDGs. 
Our e-health services, for example, help improve medical care (SDG 3). 
Our broadband expansion is giving many people access to digital edu-
cational media (SDG 4) and is actively involving us in the construction 
and expansion of high-quality infrastructure and promotion of innova-
tion (SDG 9). Many European cities are able to use our Smart City solu-
tions to reduce traffic, control their street lighting in a needs-based and 
energy-efficient manner and increase security (SDG 11). Our customers 
can use our Smart Home solutions to more effectively monitor, control 
and reduce their energy consumption. These and many other solutions 
help to reduce emissions and thereby significantly contribute to climate 
protection (SDG 13). And our cloud solutions make it possible to reduce 
energy consumption and conserve other resources as well (SDGs 12 
and 13).
The following overview illustrates our contribution to the SDGs and 
refers to specific examples from the current CR report.
Since 2016 we have also been highlighting our contribution to the 
SDGs in our Annual Report. We indicate passages in our management 
report (a part of the Annual Report) that are relevant for the SDGs with a 
corresponding icon. We've decided to use this icon in this CR report as 
well.
Achieving more together: Cooperation for sustainable development 
We cannot overcome global challenges alone. That is why we are com-
mitted to many initiatives, both within our own industry and in other sec-
tors. The following institutions have started committees, working groups 
and initiatives with direct SDG relevance and in which we are involved: 
UN Global Compact, GSMA (an association representing the interests 
of mobile operators worldwide), GeSI (Global e-Sustainability Initiative) 
and Econsense.

renewable energy) as well as with our sustainable 
products and services based on our integrated cli-
mate strategy.
Our efficient Smart Agriculture ICT solutions allow 
for higher harvest yields while reducing the use of

We also conduct projects to protect biodiversity. We 
require our suppliers to protect the environment and 
use resources responsibly.
By expanding our networks, we create the conditions 
for economic and social participation, among other 
things providing access to education - the lack of which 
is one of the main causes of poverty. We expect our 
suppliers to pay the minimum wages as set forth in the 
ILO Convention. We have explicitly formulated this in 
our Supplier Code of Conduct.

WE'RE DOING SOMETHING! - EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATION
We started a poster campaign in the summer of 2017 to create aware-
ness of the SDGs among out employees. To this end, we first distributed 
posters at our Bonn headquarters and hung them in high-traffic zones. 
In addition to illustrating all the SDGs, the posters also show Deutsche 
Telekom's contribution to achieving the goals. The posters are available 
for download here.
ALLOCATING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS 
TO OUR BENCHMARKS
Our commitment to sustainability also includes making a positive contri-
bution to achieving the SDGs. In particular, we contributeto goals no. 3: 
Good health and well-being, 4: Quality education, 5: Gender equality,  
8: Decent work and economic growth, 9: Industry, innovation, and infra-
structure, 11: Sustainable cities and communities, 12: Responsible con-
sumption and production and 13: Climate action.We record environ-
mental, social and governance (ESG) performance indicators as part of 
our CR controlling system. The following overview shows that our KPI 
system can be applied to the SDGs and also makes our positive contri-
butions measurable and visible. We have strong control parameters for 
those SDGs that are very relevant to our business model in particular. 
The clear SDG relationship that exists today will continue to be refined 
by means of our control and monitoring activities.

COMMENDATION FOR OUR COMMITMENT
For its commitment to the UN's goals, the consulting firm Pricewater-
houseCoopers honored Deutsche Telekom with the Building Public 
Trust Award for exemplary reporting practices. The jury selected 
Deutsche Telekom as best company in the "SDGs" (Sustainable Devel-
opment Goals) category for its 2016 Annual Report. According to the 
jury, Deutsche Telekom does the best job of systematically analyzing 
the contribution that its products, services and activities make to fulfill-
ing global sustainability goals. With this new prize category, the panel of 
experts takes into account current national and international reporting 
developments.

Which sustainability topics are relevant for our revenue development, 
capacity for innovation and reputation? Which topics matter to our 
stakeholders, for example our shareholders, customers and employees, 
as well as the public? In what areas and in what ways do our business 
operations impact society and the environment? We need to know the 
answers to these questions if we want to be successful in financial and 
ecological terms as well as in the eyes of society, which is why our mate-
riality process is not solely based on our own perspective but also takes 
into account the needs and interests of our stakeholders. 
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND ORGANIZATION
With 168 million mobile communications customers, around 28 million 
fixed-network and around 19 million broadband lines, we are one of the 
leading integrated telecommunications companies worldwide. We offer 
our consumers fixed-network/broadband, mobile, Internet, and Internet-
based TV products and services, as well as ICT solutions for our busi-
ness and corporate customers. We have an international focus and are 
represented in more than 50 countries. With a staff of some 217,300 
employees throughout the world, we generated revenue of 74.9 billion 
euros in the 2017 financial year, around 67 percent of which was gener-
ated outside Germany (December 31, 2017).
We believe that economic, social, and ecological aspects can be recon-
ciled; sustainability is the guiding principle behind all our actions. A 
range of sector-specific and general conditions are crucial to the suc-
cess of business activities. These include first-rate quality at reasonable 
costs – in data privacy and security, in customer service, in network 
build-out and in materials procurement – as well as qualified staff and 
good working conditions within our own Group as well as at our suppli-
ers. It is also important to consider the potential consequences of cli-
mate change for our business activities: for example, to construct our 
network infrastructure in such a way that it is protected from severe 
weather conditions, changes in temperatures and higher wind speeds. 
We also help our customers reduce their carbon footprint with innova-
tive products and services. Furthermore, we want to reduce the Group’s 
CO2 emissions despite rapid growth in data traffic and the network 
build-out that this requires. We do everything we can to ensure that our 
actions are socially acceptable, even beyond our core business. For us, 
this means conducting ourselves in a way that is ethical and compliant 
with the law and informing and involving our stakeholders in a transpar-
ent way.
You can find additional information on our business development in  
the 2017 Annual Report.
As illustrated in the diagram, our Group consists of five operating  
segments.
We strive to make an effective contribution to sustainable development 
along all parts of our supply chain.
MATERIAL SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS: SYSTEMATIC PROCESS 
BASED ON RECOGNIZED METHODS
We systematically identify which topics are of particular importance in 
defining Deutsche Telekom's sustainability management and sustaina-
bility reporting focus from the perspective of our stakeholders as well as 
from an internal corporate perspective. The analysis is based on knowl-
edge from previous year's results and assesses these in the light of 
recent developments.
Since 2015, we implement this materiality process at our company in 
compliance with the methodology of the Global e-Sustainability Initiative 
(GeSI). This methodology covers 55 topics that are material to the ICT 
industry. These can be placed into nine categories: digital inclusion, 
employee relationships, climate change, circular economy, sourcing 
and manufacturing, customer relationships, freedom of expression and 
privacy, governance and management, and local community and envi-
ronment impacts. The advantage of using the GeSI methodology is that 
it allows us to focus on our core business as an ICT service provider. 
The materiality topics have been developed to pertain to a variety of 
companies and are therefore recognized in the industry

Material topics from the stakeholder perspective
In our continuous online survey, our stakeholders can not only rate top-
ics according to their importance but also assess our performance in 
the respective areas (click herefor the online survey). In the survey, 
stakeholders are asked to rate the topics that have been identified 
through our internal materiality process. This ongoing, logical process 
makes it possible to achieve comparable results. To help us identify 
which aspects are most material for our stakeholders, we assessed the 
results of the survey for the period from January 1, 2016, through 
December 31, 2017. The assessment was based on evaluations sub-
mitted by 218 people:
 
93 customers
 
55 employees and potential employees or employee representatives
 
17 analysts and investors
 
15 participants from the worlds of science, research and education
 
19 NGO representatives
 
4 suppliers
 
3 representatives from regulatory authorities and political decision-
makers
 
12 employees who associated themselves with none of the groups 
mentioned 
In addition to giving stakeholders a chance to rate the importance of 
topics and assess our performance, the survey also includes open-
ended questions. You can find our stakeholder feedback from the 
reporting period here.
Stakeholders also have the opportunity to assess our performance in 
different areas. Our stakeholders rate our performance high in the key 
areas of privacy, data security and cyber safety. In contrast, they see 
potential for improvement in the topics of open sourcing and conflict 
materials (as of December 2017).
Material topics from the corporate perspective
New developments that are of importance to our sustainability engage-
ment are also evaluated internally. We hold workshops at the Group 
when required so that various topics can be weighted internally. Most 
recently in November 2015, numerous experts from different depart-
ments, including Human Resources, Innovation and Communications, 
participated in one of these workshops. They went through the 55 GeSI 
topics and identified those that had the most impact on five key value 
drivers behind our business success from a corporate perspective (see 
below). These value drivers are also based on the GeSI methodology:
 
Technology and innovation: Our customers' increasing demand for 
secure, encrypted services has made topics like data security and 
cyber security two of the most significant drivers of innovation at our 
company. 
 
Revenue growth: We are able to tap new markets and reach out to 
new customers through network expansion. High service qualityis 
decisive when it comes to customer satisfaction and therefore has  
a direct impact on winning over customers and customer loyalty. 
Customer inquiries about sustainable products are still limited in 
number but continue to grow, which is why this topic has been iden-
tified as an important driver
 
Business operations: Which topics have a positive impact on busi-
ness processes or help reduce costs? Above all comprehensive 
employee involvement and fundamental requirements such as data 
security, service quality, stakeholder involvement and compliance 
have an impact here. 
 
Employee relations: The topics of talent acquisition, employee 
retention, development and downsizing, employee involvement, 
employee health, safety and well-being as well as diversity and anti-
discrimination also have a big impact on employee satisfaction and 
productivity. A service-oriented corporate culture (service quality), 
ethical business practices and transparency as well have a positive 
impact on employee relations 
 
Reputation: A high degree of transparency and extensive reporting 
create lasting trust in Deutsche Telekom. Topics such as business 
practices, service quality, privacy and supply chain labor standards, 
on the other hand, can pose risks to our reputation. If the media 
negatively reports on our brands, products or services in connection 
with these topics, this can damage our reputation. 
The next workshop on internal weighing of topics is slated for the third 
quarter of 2018.
RESULTS OF THE MATERIALITY ANALYSIS
In our materiality analysis topics are rated as "very relevant," "relevant," 
"less relevant" and "not relevant." We translate their weighting results 
onto a 100-point scale. Here are the results of the analysis.
The overall result
The following illustration shows how all of the topics were rated by our 
stakeholders and from a corporate perspective on a scale of 0 to 100.
Top topics for Deutschen Telekom's sustainable business 
development
We consider all topics that achieved more than 70 points on average in 
the materiality process to be top topics. They are presented on a scale 
of 60 to 100 below.

As a company, we are constantly balancing the expectations of a variety 
of stakeholders when managing our business. That is why our success 
depends on recognizing the interests and demands of our internal and 
external stakeholders and meeting and addressing these whenever pos-
sible and reasonable. Stakeholders also expect to be kept informed of 
how companies are responding to their requirements. We go even fur-
ther by actively surveying our stakeholders and involving them in our 
corporate activities.
Engaging in dialog with our stakeholders helps us identify trends early 
on, which fosters our innovation processes. At the same time, this 
strengthens existing alliances and creates new opportunities for part-
nerships. This is particularly important in terms of our sustainability tar-
gets, which we can only achieve in collaboration with partners from the 
worlds of politics (political advocacy), society, science and research, 
and industry.

FOSTERING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
We systematically encourage stakeholder engagement in our corporate 
activities. In 2011 we developed a strategy for stakeholder engagement 
in order to manage our various activities throughout the Group. The 
strategy is based on the three AA1000 principles developed by the 
NGO AccountAbility: materiality, inclusivity, and responsiveness. We 
reviewed compliance with these principles in 2013.
In addition to the annual stakeholder survey, we use various formats 
such as memberships and events to enter into dialog with our stake-
holders. We also use the information of our NGO radar as well as infor-
mal exchange to inform our stakeholders about our requirements.
The feedback that we receive from our stakeholders through various 
channels is incorporated into our CR activities. We regularly ascertain 
what our stakeholders think of our activities and modify our CR strategy, 
if needed. To this end, we primarily use our materiality process and CR 
topic monitoring.
FEEDBACK FROM THE STAKEHOLDER SURVEY
Our ongoing stakeholder survey (To the survey) includes not only 
weighting topics (2017 results) and assessment of our sustainability 
performance but open-ended questions as well. Below is a summary of 
the most important feedback results for the 2017 reporting year, which 
we use to advance our CR activities.
Stakeholder recommendations on how Deutsche Telekom can further 
improve its corporate responsibility:
 
Raising awareness of sustainable consumption among its  
customers (the "a new cell phone every year" principle goes against 
the sustainability principle
 
Implementation of a renewable energies strategy
 
Active marketing of products with a good carbon footprint
Requirements concerning the sustainability of Deutsche Telekom 
products:
 
Energy efficiency
 
Reusability
 
Use of recycled materials
Requirements on network expansion:
 
Nationwide basic service with fast Internet
Expectations on sustainability rating in the supply chain:
 
Stricter analysis of sustainability risks in the supply chain 
Suggestions for strengthening commitment to sustainability among 
employees and in the corporate culture:
 
Promotion of employee networks
 
Establishment of an open and non-discriminatory corporate culture
 
Transparent communication especially with regard to target  
agreements
 
Harsher consequences for misconduct
FORMATS FOR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
The type and extent of our stakeholder engagement is based on the 
results of a case-related relevance analysis. Stakeholder relevance var-
ies depending on the topic. In the sustainable finance area, for example, 
our investors are the most important stakeholders, which is why we are 
in regular communication with them. Of course, our customers play a 
decisive role in the development of sustainable products. The more rele-
vant a stakeholder group is to the topic or project concerned, the more 
intensive stakeholder engagement can be. Depending on the intensity, 
we make a distinction between three types of engagement: information, 
dialog and participation.

At Deutsche Telekom AG we feel it is highly important that all of our 
employees and governance bodies comply with our values, rules of con-
duct and applicable laws at all times. Deutsche Telekom's central com-
pliance organization (Group Compliance) plays a key role in establish-
ing corporate governance structures and a corporate culture based on 
integrity. It promotes a culture and a set of values characterized by com-
pliance at the company and encourages managers and employees to 
live these values. As a result, Deutsche Telekom's understanding of 
what compliance means far exceeds pure legal compliance in business 
activity, i.e., compliance with laws and internal regulations, and focuses 
on the integrity of employees and governance bodies.

ENSURING INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE 
We have clearly expressed our commitment to complying with ethical 
principles and current legal standards. This commitment has been 
incorporated in our Guiding Principles and Code of Conduct. We have 
introduced a comprehensive compliance management system. This is 
a way to effectively combat risks and make sure conduct throughout the 
Group is based on integrity and complies with our principles and regu-
lations. All activities related to compliance management fulfill legal reg-
ulations and our Binding Corporate Rules on Privacy. This policy regu-
lates how personal data is handled at Deutsche Telekom. Responsibility 
for the compliance management system lies with the top management 
level at Deutsche Telekom in the Board department for Data Privacy, 
Legal Affairs and Compliance. In addition, there is a member in each 
company of Deutsche Telekom at the Management or Board level who 
is responsible for compliance. The Chief Compliance Officer of 
Deutsche Telekom AG is responsible for the Group-wide structure, 
advancement and implementation of the compliance management 
system. This individual also heads up the Group Compliance unit. We 
also have compliance officers (COs) at each of our operating segments 
and national companies These individuals are responsible for ensuring 
that the compliance management system and our compliance goals are 
implemented on site.
Goals of the compliance management system
At Deutsche Telekom, compliance refers to following the rules and 
doing the "right thing", which means compliance requires all employees 
to act with integrity. Within the meaning of our five Guiding Principles 
and Code of Conduct, integrity, and therefore compliance, forms the 
basis of all our business decisions and activities. It defines the behavior 
of all our employees when dealing with customers, employees and 
colleagues, investors, managers and Deutsche Telekom's general envi-
ronment.
The goals of our compliance activities are based on these principles, 
the relevant regulations and legal standards as well as on our strategic 
objective of becoming the leading European telecommunications 
provider. Specifically, the purpose is to avoid compliance violations and 
business decisions that are not made with integrity. In addition, compli-
ance should be integrated early on and permanently into business 
processes. This reduces liability risks for the company. Furthermore, 
compliance contributes to ensuring that our customers perceive us as 
a reliable partner. We ensure implementation of our overarching compli-
ance goals in business activities by systematically applying the compli-
ance management system in the areas of prevention, identification and 
response.
Focus on prevention
Each year, we carry out a Group-wide Compliance Risk Assessment. 
This helps us identify and assess our compliance risks and define focal 
points for conducting effective preventative measures, which are com-
piled in our compliance program.
The goal is to make sure that the conduct of our employees is ethical 
and compliant at all times, which is why we have set forth clear expecta-
tions on employee conduct in our Code of Conduct. We have intro-
duced compliance-related Group policies for this purpose, such as reg-
ulations on anti-corruption measures, gifts, invitations, and events, as 
well as on handling consultants and agents. A policy database makes 
it easy for our employees to access and follow our policies (Group-wide 
implementation of the Code of Conduct).
Besides regular compliance training sessions, we also carry out com-
prehensive anti-corruption training (see GRI 205-2). We specifically 
address managers to act as multipliers to further raise awareness of 
compliance. Their feedback is analyzed carefully and used to initiate 
additional training sessions or other measures, if necessary.
Employees can also visit the "Ask me!" portal to have their compliance 
questions answered. The “Ask me!” advisory team gives answers in

case of behavioral uncertainties. The portal contains an FAQ with exem-
plary cases and reliable information on laws, internal policies, and 
behavioral standards.
We have also introduced various measures to promote a culture of  
compliance at our company.
Identification and monitoring
Despite the best preventative measures, we are not always able to pre-
vent breaches of law or serious violations of internal regulations at the 
company. We have created the Tell me! whistleblower portal to uncover 
non-compliant conduct. Our employees as well as external parties, e.g., 
business partners or customers, can use the portal to report miscon-
duct (Protecting whistleblowers). Deutsche Telekom thoroughly investi-
gates all reports within the limits of the legal framework and punishes 
such activity appropriately. We have introduced a Group-wide reporting 
process to control and monitor these activities, including regular inter-
nal and external audits of our compliance management activities.
Compliant interaction with business partners and suppliers
Our Code of Conduct specifies proper conduct for all of our employees. 
With our Code of Human Rights & Social Principles (a successor to the 
Social Charter img [Link 12841]), we make a commitment to protecting 
and promoting human rights including compliance with the ILO's core 
labor standards. Our Supplier Code of Conduct stipulates that our sup-
pliers as well as their sub-contractors must comply with the principles 
and values set forth by our Code of Conduct and the Code of Human 
Rights & Social Principles that places suppliers under the obligation to 
take all steps necessary to prevent and punish active and passive forms 
of corruption. The Code of Conduct is part of the General Terms and 
Conditions for Purchasing but does not replace the laws and regula-
tions of countries where our suppliers are active. Rather, its aim is to 
facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations and guarantee 
that they are implemented faithfully and effectively. We have been 
offering e-learning on compliance to our suppliers since 2014, as well 
as providing them with a compliance guideline.
We select our business partners based on compliance criteria and con-
duct risk-oriented compliance business assessments. This applies to 
customers and suppliers as well as consultants (Consultant Policy), 
sales agents, development partners, and joint venture partners.
STREAMLINED, EASIER, BETTER: A REVISED CODE 
OF CONDUCT
Integrity, respect and compliance with the law – this is the principle on 
which Deutsche Telekom’s business activities are based. Our Code of 
Conduct sets forth the central reference framework for legally compliant 
and moral conduct. We revised the Code in 2017, with the goal of focus-
ing on issues of compliance and integrity and finding a positive way to 
raise employee awareness of, and motivation to tackle, these issues. 
The revised Code of Conduct continues to provide an overview of our 
understanding of values and of the basic principles that guide our 
actions. In some places, this overview provides more detail by referring 
to internal policies and regulations. The Code of Conduct makes a sig-
nificant contribution to our business success by providing a fixed foun-
dation for our business activities.
RENEWED COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION
In 2017, we once again had our compliance management system certi-
fied with a focus on anti-corruption measures. This is our way of ensur-
ing that we can confront risks consistently and that we have established 
effective processes in the company. After 10 companies were audited in 
Germany in 2016, we had 12 international companies certified in 2017.
The certification focused on processes in Procurement, Sales, HR, and 
Mergers & Acquisitions, as well as on events, donations, and sponsor-
ships. The potential danger of corruption is greatest in these areas. The 
auditors completed their audit of the effectiveness of our compliance 
management system, and the system passed with flying colors. We doc-
ument details regarding audit content and corporate departments that 
have undergone anti-corruption audits in our audit report.
Certificates and audit assessments play an ever-increasing role, for 
instance in bidding processes and decisions to award bids, offering a 
clear advantage whenever we are in competition with other companies. 
External auditors previously certified our compliance management 
system with a focus on anti-corruption measures and anti-trust law in 
2010 and 2013.
STRENGTHENING OUR CORPORATE CULTURE, ENCOURAGING 
A SPEAK-UP CULTURE
A compliance management system is only effective if it is actually imple-
mented in everyday activities. This is why we started the Transparent 
Company Culture initiative in 2016 with the intention of encouraging 
integrity and a speak-up culture within our company.
We conducted a large-scale employee survey in this context in the 
spring of 2017 to find out more about Deutsche Telekom's corporate 
culture and how it is being lived – especially with a view towards compli-
ance topics. About 52,000 employees in 25 national and international 
Deutsche Telekom companies took part in the online survey. There 
were also one-to-one interviews and discussions with focus groups. 
The European School of Management and Technology (ESMT Berlin) 
and Hertie School of Governance were our research partners in this 
extensive study.
The initiative was supported by an expert committee created specifi-
cally for this purpose. The committee was comprised of Deutsche 
Telekom employees as well as representatives from non-governmental 
organizations, the business and scientific communities and society. 
The experts' task was to guide and assess the study. The results are 
positive overall. The vast majority of employees is committed to 
Deutsche Telekom's rules and is not willing to act in an unethical 
manner. The strengths of the compliance culture include, among 
others, the clarity of the rules, the willingness of employees to report 
misconduct and the ethical conduct of direct supervisors. An admitted 
weakness is the fact that there is a small group of employees who are 
willing to break the rules. Identified weaknesses were intensely dis-
cussed by the Board of Management and included in a set of measures 
for further strengthening the value-oriented compliance culture at 
Deutsche Telekom.

The Speak-up Culture initiative: Constructive criticism expressly 
wanted
One measure from the Transparent Corporate Culture initiative is that 
the Speak-up Culture initiative will continue to be implemented with 
various focal areas. The goal of the campaign is to encourage objection 
within the company where this is necessary. Employees should be 
encouraged to correctly and successfully address grievances in critical 
situations, just as managers should be open to hearing these griev-
ances. An environment should also be created wherein "critical minds" 
can voice their opinions. Both classroom and online courses will be 
offered, nationally and internationally, to this end.
WITHOUT BORDERS: WORLDWIDE COOPERATION FOR 
COMPLIANCE
Different legal practices and cultural values in the countries where 
Deutsche Telekom is active represent a significant compliance chal-
lenge. The increasingly dynamic development of global markets and 
intensified international competition also influence our compliance 
strategy.
In line with the Group's international orientation, we discuss strategic 
issues with an international compliance advisory team twice a year. The 
team is a trend-setter of sorts for designing and implementing balanced 
compliance structures at Deutsche Telekom. We have also been pro-
moting Group-wide compliance cooperation for years through meetings 
of the representatives of all compliance organizations from our interna-
tional subsidiaries.
Compliance Days in Warsaw: Be together – Talk together – 
Create together
The International Compliance Days took place for the 13th time in May 
2017. Under the motto "Be together – Talk together – Create together", 
around 100 compliance officers from more than 20 countries met in 
Warsaw, Poland. During the two-day event, experts discussed current 
compliance topics such as digitalization and veto rights and attended 
workshops where they worked together on further refining these topics.
Deutsche Telekom rated one of the most ethical companies in the 
world in 2018
The Arizona-based Ethisphere Institute ranked Deutsche Telekom as 
one of the world's most ethical companies in 2018. We received this 
honor upon our first attempt, since this is the first time that we took part 
in this survey. In Germany, we are the sole recipient of this honor. 
Ethisphere commends the excellent performance of companies with 
the highest ethical competence worldwide. In addition to Deutsche 
Telekom and T-Mobile US, the ethics institute recognized another 133 
companies in 23 countries and 57 industries as "2018 World’s Most 
Ethical Companies".
PREVENTING AND FIGHTING CORRUPTION
We take many different actions and measures to prevent and fight 
corruption. The compliance risk assessment forms the foundation of  
our compliance management system. It helps us identify and evaluate 
compliance risks and develop appropriate preventive measures. We 
have established an annual process for this purpose Group-wide. It 
identifies responsible officers and defines clear assessment criteria that 
are documented in a traceable manner. The companies that will take 
part in the compliance risk assessment are selected using a model cen-
tered on how developed and complete their compliance programs are. 
73 companies participated in the assessment process in 2017.
Our Group risk map is a key component of the compliance risk assess-
ment that we use to assess risks that are particularly significant to our 
company. The risk map enables Deutsche Telekom's companies with 
their various business models to conduct systematic risk analyses. It 
currently covers 27 core risk categories ranging from corruption and 
anti-trust law violations to violations of the Group Code of Conduct. 
Each national company can add additional categories specific to their 
business needs. This involves defining which specific threat each risk 
poses to the national company and stating which measures have 
already been implemented to mitigate this risk. If necessary, additional 
measures are developed to reduce the risks to a manageable level. 
Responsibility for conducting the compliance risk assessment lies with 
the respective national company. Our central compliance organization 
provides support and advice in these matters.
The national companies' managing boards are informed of the results 
of the compliance risk assessment. Subsequently, the compliance pro-
gram for the following year is defined, including specific measures and 
responsibilities. The managing board then passes a formal resolution to 
approve the program. The compliance program measures are moni-
tored closely.
Investigation of suspected corruption based on clear criteria-
Deutsche Telekom has specified clear criteria for investigating sus-
pected cases of corruption. We start investigations if a violation of legal 
or internal regulations is reported with a sufficient degree of detail. Any 
tips that meet this requirement are investigated thoroughly. Any viola-
tions we uncover are punished appropriately. In some cases employ-
ment relationships have even been terminated for good cause. Claims 
for damages may also be asserted. Any weaknesses identified in the 
internal control system during the investigation are systematically ana-
lyzed and remedied.
"TELL ME!" PORTAL: 146 REPORTS RECEIVE
In 2017, 146 compliance-related reports were made to Deutsche  
Telekom via the "Tell me!" portal (108 reports were made in the previ-
ous year). 24 of those are still being reviewed for plausibility and investi-
gations are being made into 66 plausible reports (as of January 16, 
2018). 43 of these were confirmed as actual misconduct and were  
punished accordingly. 12 cases are still in the investigation phase. In 
confirmed cases, we impose systematic sanctions that are proportion-
ate to the act and the guilt of the perpetrator and are in line with applica-
ble legal provisions. Most of the tip-offs received in 2017 related to 
potential cases of commission fraud, manipulation of targets, misappro-
priation, theft and fraud.
In principle, we always follow up on all compliance-relevant tip-offs, 
even those that reach us through other channels.
INVOLVEMENT IN ANTI-CORRUPTION INITIATIVES
Deutsche Telekom AG regularly joins forces with national and inter-
national organizations that deal specifically with compliance-related 
issues, including combating corruption. As a member of associations

and organizations such as the Compliance & Integrity forum of ZfW 
(Center for Business Ethics), DICO (Deutsches Institut für Compli-
ance e.V. - German Institute for Compliance), Bitkom (Federal Asso-
ciation for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New 
Media), Deutsche Telekom makes use of the opportunity to 
exchange ideas and experiences related to compliance. Thanks to 
this collaborative approach and exchange of experiences, Deutsche 
Telekom AG not only makes a valuable contribution to anti-corrup-
tion within the Group, but also to initiatives in this field worldwide. 
Deutsche Telekom AG uses the findings to work on continually 
improving its compliance management system.
MAJOR ONGOING LITIGATION
Deutsche Telekom is party to several proceedings both in and out of 
court with government agencies, competitors and other parties. The 
proceedings mentioned in the 2017 Annual Report are of particular 
importance from Deutsche Telekom's point of view.

The political sector and regulatory authorities influence the develop-
ment and availability of the network infrastructure, technologies and 
services. This directly impacts the competitiveness of telecommunica-
tions companies as well as business in general, which relies on having 
a fast network infrastructure as well as state-of-the-art telecommunica-
tions services. Networks and services are also of considerable impor-
tance for maintaining a sense of community in society, which is why we 
engage in active, ongoing dialog with all interested stakeholders from 
the spheres of politics and society. 
LOBBYING TOOLS
Our partners from parliaments, governments and non-profit organiza-
tions need to uphold their independence and integrity. This principle is 
codified in Deutsche Telekom's Code of Conduct. Donations to political 
institutions, parties and political representatives are not allowed, for 
example. Instead, we place importance on factual communication, com-
petence, credibility and integrity. As a result, politicians and stakehold-
ers feel that the information we provide is authentic and credible and 
refer to this information when forming their own opinions. Deutsche 
Telekom is registered in the official transparency register for lobbyists in 
Brussels. Within the context of our collaboration efforts in associations 
and other bodies, we feel that we are under the obligation to comply 
with all ethical codes and legal provisions.
INVESTMENT INCENTIVE NEEDED FOR BROADBAND NETWORKS
Having a high-performance, reliable and secure broadband infrastruc-
ture is the basis of success for all business sectors and is a key factor in 
making a business location attractive. Deutsche Telekom has been 
investing extensively in infrastructure for fixed-line and mobile (fiber-
optic) Internet for years, making a considerable contribution and show-
ing more commitment than any other company to providing full-area 
coverage, particularly in rural areas.
In view of the ambitious broadband goals at both the national and Euro-
pean level, the main purpose of telecommunications and regulatory pol-
icies needs to be improving planning security and, in particular, the 
financial power of companies willing to invest in the market. This is the 
only way to fully tap private network expansion potential using all availa-
ble technologies. In areas where broadband roll-out is not economically 
feasible, it is up to the public sector to develop far-sighted technology 
and provider-independent incentive programs to help effectively finance 
these efforts. Legal frameworks and regulatory practice need to actively 
support private-sector investment in new fiber-optic networks and pre-
vent unnecessary financial burdens and red tape for the network opera-
tors investing in networks.
Regulatory intervention needs to be restricted to proven market failure 
to keep it from unnecessarily limiting innovation. Open access must be 
embraced as a basic principle so that competition and free choice for 
consumers are guaranteed in connection with all network expansion 
projects.
In view of the fact that the Internet and telecommunications market are 
converging rapidly and in light of the growing market power of a few 
global Internet players, sector-specific regulation of telecommunica-
tions is creating more and more of an imbalance. The same laws and 
regulations that apply to telecommunications companies also need to 
apply to Internet companies providing the same services. The objective 
here must be to create equal competitive conditions and enable fair 
distribution of the financial burden involved in broadband expansion.
PROTECTING THE OPEN INTERNET
As part of the EU Telecoms Package, regulations on network neutrality 
were adopted at the EU level and went into effect on April 30, 2016. 
The new regulations particularly address permitted traffic management, 
once again raise transparency requirements and limit commercial prod-
uct and service differentiation on the Internet.
Deutsche Telekom remains committed to preserving an open Internet. 
Content and services will continue to be available online in accordance 
with the best effort principle, meaning they will be available to the extent 
permitted by the available resources. Deutsche Telekom will continue to 
expand and optimize its infrastructure so that we are able to cope with 
rapidly increasing amounts of data traffic and constantly upgrade our 
network. This is the only way for us to meet our customers' increasing 
demands and live up to the requirements of online content and applica-
tion providers who also want to provide their services in high quality in 
the future. However, telecommunication networks cannot be operated 
without an effective network management system.
Building on the best effort Internet, Deutsche Telekom is developing an 
innovative network architecture – so-called 5G networks – which can 
better and more flexibly meet the various transmission quality require-
ments of the various services. We thereby fulfill business and regulatory 
requirements and enable innovation in the services we offer on our net-
works. Content will in no way be controlled, however. Deutsche Telekom 
supports Internet freedom and does not influence user or provider con-
tent in any way. Deutsche Telekom will continue to take a non-discrimi-
natory approach to marketing services with different quality-of-service 
levels in competition with other network operators. This gives consum-
ers greater choice and guarantees a high quality level.

CONSUMER DIALOG
Deutsche Telekom aims to become the leading European telco. That is 
why we again gave high priority to consumer-related topics in 2017.
Main topics included the following:
 
Maintaining consumer data privacy, such as in the online advertising 
business, 
 
Improving comprehensive, cross-technology protection of young 
people at national and EU levels (in particular by advancing a  
comprehensive, Group-wide minimum standard within the EU and 
ongoing dialog with organizations involved in the protection of 
minors both nationally and at EU level), 
 
Improving customer service standards,
 
Improving consumer protection in telecommunications (e.g., during 
ongoing IP migration and when switching providers for fixed-line 
and mobile connections), and 
 
Our efforts to provide better transparency for our customers  
(e.g. the data protection one-pager).
Within the scope of ongoing IP migration in the fixed-line network, 
Deutsche Telekom has switched most of its customers to IP, especially 
in the last three years, and has undertaken numerous user-friendly 
measures to make the migration as easy and seamless as possible for 
customers. Deutsche Telekom is also continuing its commitment in 
issues of provider switching, with the goal being to make it easier for 
both fixed-network and mobile consumers to switch providers without 
any service interruptions. In all these areas, Deutsche Telekom stands 
for a constructive and solution-oriented approach that is geared to both 
the consumers' interests and the interests of our company.

As an international player, the Deutsche Telekom Group assigns high 
priority to human rights compliance, especially since the ICT sector is 
frequently criticized for deficiencies in its supply chain. That is why we 
have established comprehensive social standards at Deutsche Telekom 
and implement these using appropriate methods. We attach particular 
importance to granting the right to collective bargaining and supporting 
diversity and equal opportunities. We expressly require our suppliers to 
assume responsibility as a way of making sure human rights are also 
protected outside of our Group.

HOW WE PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS
Deutsche Telekom has made an express commitment to the UN Guid-
ing Principles on Business and Human Rights published by the United 
Nations Human Rights Council in 2011. These principles require busi-
nesses to systematically identify the impact their operations have on 
human rights, and to prevent, mitigate or compensate these where nec-
essary. In order to meet these requirements, we have developed an 
extensive program to implement the UN Guiding Principles and intro-
duced an ongoing process comprised of several interconnected meas-
ures and tools (see diagram).
The obligation to respect human rights is anchored in Deutsche  
Telekom's basic policies, the Guiding Principles and the Code of 
Human Rights & Social Principles (formerly Social Charter). The 
Deutsche Telekom Employee Relations Policy and Diversity Policy  
are also important in this context.
Tools for assessing potential impact on human rights
We use two tools to assess compliance with our Code of Human Rights 
& Social Principles: first, each year we prepare a central Human Rights 
and Social Performance Report, in which 103 fully consolidated compa-
nies of Deutsche Telekom participate. This report did not record any 
violations of our guidelines and principles during the period from Janu-
ary to December 2017. We have also been offering a central contact 
point for human rights issues since 2013. This contact point can be 
reached via various channels, for example the public e-mail address 
humanrights@telekom.de. People can also use our anonymous whistle-
blower system, which allows them to submit their information anony-
mously. All contact options are listed on our Tell me! whistleblower por-
tal, the purpose of which is to resolve violations of legal regulations and 
internal policies. We look into all tip-offs and reports received and intro-
duce countermeasures as soon as the information is identified as plau-
sible. You can find out how we handled the reports we received in 2017 
here. We also continued the process launched in 2013 to integrate 
human rights issues into the due diligence activities conducted in the 
context of mergers and acquisitions.
Based on need, we also introduce special evaluation processes to 
assess employer-employee relations in the national companies with 
which we implement our Employee Relations Policy. In this context,  
we also take into account the results provided by our Human Rights & 
Employee Relations Cockpit. This is a tool to measure progress at our 
national companies on the basis of five indicators pertaining to human 
rights:
1.  Employee satisfaction (source: semi-annual pulse survey)
2. Willingness to recommend Deutsche Telekom as an employer  
 
(source: semi-annual pulse survey)
3. Health rate (source: HSE img cockpit)
4. Number of employees giving notice (source: HSE cockpit)
5. Human rights risks at national companies (according to Maplecroft 
 
Human Rights Risk Index)
Our national companies are classified according to a traffic-light system 
for their results in each indicator: green (requirements met), yellow 
(requirements partially met) and red (requirements not met). The results 
are then discussed with the regional managers at the national compa-
nies and measures like human rights impact assessments and 
employee relations policy reviews are arranged as necessary.
Human rights in the supply chain
We expressly require our suppliers to assume responsibility as a way of 
making sure human rights are also protected outside of our Group. To 
this end, we supplemented our sustainable procurement strategy with 
STRATEGY & MANAGEMENT

supplier management to improve our sustainability performance in our 
supply chain and ensure respect for human rights. The detailed results 
of our Group-wide auditing program are available here.
SOCIAL CHARTER BECOMES CODE OF HUMAN RIGHTS & 
SOCIAL PRINCIPLES 
In 2017 we revised our Social Charter and renamed it Code of Human 
Rights & Social Principles, which was adopted by the Board of Manage-
ment in November 2017. This update underscores our commitment to 
protecting human rights and to the goals of the German National Action 
Plan on Business and Human Rights adopted by the Federal Govern-
ment in 2016. There were only some minor content changes. Among 
other things, a statement was incorporated summoning all employees  
to respect and promote human rights and social principles. We also 
changed some of the wording. The human rights principles are now 
mentioned more explicitly, and our existing processes and strategies 
explained in more detail. The reason for the revision was primarily the 
increased expectations of governments, NGOs and other stakeholders.
Additionally, the Code of Human Rights & Social Principles is our com-
mitment to complying with the guidelines and the Declaration of Princi-
ples concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy issued by 
the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Organisation for Eco-
nomic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Universal Declara-
tion of Human Rights as well as with the UN Guidelines for Business 
and Human Rights and the UN Global Compact.
REPORTS AND INQUIRIES TO THE CONTACT POINT FOR  
HUMAN RIGHTS
We established a contact point for human rights at Deutsche Telekom 
in 2013. Between January 1 and December 31, 2017, the contact point 
received seven reports related to human rights, submitted either directly 
to the contact point or through the (anonymous) whistleblower portal. 
Not all of these tip-offs were deemed plausible. Most of the inquiries 
and reports related to the topic of "compliance and verification of 
human rights at Deutsche Telekom". A few reports related to the topic  
of ongoing professional education. We also received several fundrais-
ing and support questions, which we forwarded to the appropriate col-
leagues. Of course, all reports were treated as confidential.
STRATEGY & MANAGEMENT 
HUMAN RIGHTS
54
For us, comprehensive risk and opportunity management also means 
considering the opportunities and risks arising from ecological or social 
aspects or from the management of our company. To this end, we 
actively and systematically involve all relevant stakeholders in the pro-
cess of identifying current and potential risks and opportunities. We 
also participate in a number of working groups and committees. In par-
allel with our ongoing monitoring of ecological, social and governance 
issues, we systematically determine our stakeholders' positions on 
these issues. The key tools we use here are: our year-round open online 
materiality survey for all stakeholders; our bi-monthly NGO report, which 
systematically analyzes press publications of the NGOs relevant for us; 
our involvement in working groups and committees, countless national 
and international business associations, and social organizations, e.g., 
GeSI img, BID, Bitkom, Econsense, and BAGSO; stakeholder dialog for-
mats organized by us, such as this year’s ICT and Climate Stakeholder 
Day under the motto "The impact of ICT on climate change – curse or 
blessing"; and our various publications, such as the press reviews and 
newsletters.
We have identified the following as our main sustainability management 
issues: 
REPUTATION
How we deal with sustainability issues also entails both opportunities 
and risks for our reputation. A high level of service quality is one of the 
most important factors for improving customer perception. Customer 
satisfaction has been embedded in our Group management as a non-
financial performance indicator to underline the importance of this 
issue. Transparency and reporting help to promote the trust of other 
external stakeholders in our Group. Our annual and CR reports also 
serve this purpose. However, issues such as business practices, data 
privacy and work standards in the supply chain and conduct in relation 
to human rights also entail reputation risks. If our brands, products or 
services are connected with such issues in negative media reports, this 
can cause substantial damage to our reputation. As part of our sustaina-
bility management activities, we continuously review such potential 
risks and take measures to minimize them. We also ascertain how our 
products and services make a positive contribution to sustainability in 
order to enhance our reputation.
CLIMATE PROTECTION
We pursue an integrated climate strategy, which means focusing not 
only on the risks that climate change poses for us and our stakeholders, 
but also on the opportunities it presents. By 2030, ICT products and 
services will have the potential to save up to ten times as much in CO2 
emissions in other industries as the ICT sector itself generates (accord-
ing to the GeSI SMARTer2030 study). This creates an opportunity to 
save 20 percent of global CO2 emissions in 2030 and to keep worldwide 
emissions at 2015 levels with simultaneous economic growth. The addi-
tional revenue potential here amounts to 6.5 trillion US dollars, 2.0 tril-
lion US dollars of which is for the ICT industry alone. Further, ICT solu-
tions can save a total of 4.9 trillion US dollars in costs. To give a specific 
example: The broadband rollout in Germany has the potential to save an 
aggregate amount of 19 million metric tons of CO2 between 2012 and 
2020. What's more, the economic momentum triggered by rolling out 
broadband can create an aggregate number of 162,000 new jobs and 
increase GDP by 47 billion euros between 2015 and 2020. We are sup-
porting this trend by evaluating our product portfolio to identify sustain-
ability benefits. In addition, we want to continuously improve the ratio of 
the emissions that our products and services save to those generated 
by our own value chain. In 2016, for example, we saved 33 percent 
more emissions in Germany than we produced.
Among the risks that climate change harbors, meteorological extremes 
are one we are already experiencing. This is having a direct effect on 
our stakeholders, e.g., our customers, suppliers, and employees. We 
can take preventive action in this area by reducing our own CO2 emis-
sions, which is one of the reasons we set ourselves the goal of achieving 
a 20 percent reduction in our Group-wide emissions – leaving aside our 
United States operating segment – by 2020 (baseline: 2008). Climate 
protection also carries financial risks, whether from the introduction of 
a levy on CO2 emissions or an increase in energy costs. The measures 
we are taking to counter these risks include measuring our own energy 
efficiency and finding ways to improve it. Further, in 2016 four of our 
subsidiaries (Magyar Telekom in Hungary, OTE in Greece, T-Mobile 
Netherlands, and Hrvatski Telekom in Croatia) covered 100 percent of 
their electricity requirements with renewable energy, while a further two 
(T-Mobile Austria and T-Systems Netherlands) almost met this target, 
thus reducing climate risks.
SUPPLIERS
We see more sustainability in our supply chain as an opportunity – for 
our reputation and our business success. Apart from the general risks 
associated with our global procurement activities, we can be exposed to 
country- and supplier-specific risks. These include, for example, the use 
of child labor, the conscious acceptance of environmental damage or 
inadequate local working and safety conditions. We reduce these risks 
by systematically reviewing our suppliers. Our partnerships with suppli-
ers that comply with international sustainability standards ensure a high 
level of product quality and reliable procurement. We have a special 
development program in place to help strategic suppliers introduce 
business practices that are both socially and ecologically acceptable 
while remaining economically efficient. This program again showed 
measurable successes in the reporting period and has three major 
advantages: It has a positive impact on our suppliers’ working condi-
tions, enhances their profitability, and makes the economic relevance 
of sustainability clear for both sides, i.e., for our suppliers and for the 
Group alike. For instance, better working conditions at our suppliers

reduces the number of work-related accidents as well as the staff churn 
rate. That, in turn, ensures high product quality and increases productiv-
ity, while at the same time lowering costs for recruitment and training. 
Thus, not only are we strengthening our suppliers’ profitability and CR 
performance, we are also significantly reducing identified risks.
HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Mobile communications, or the electromagnetic fields used in mobile 
communications, regularly give rise to concerns among the general 
population about potential health risks. This issue continues to be the 
subject of public, political, and scientific debate. Acceptance problems 
among the general public concern both mobile communications net-
works and the use of mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and 
laptops. The discussion also has repercussions for the build-out of 
mobile communications infrastructure and the use of mobile devices.  
In the fixed network, it affects sales of traditional IP and DECT (digital 
cordless) phones and devices that use Wi-Fi technology. There is a risk 
of regulatory interventions, such as reduced thresholds for electromag-
netic fields or the implementation of precautionary measures in mobile 
communications, e.g., amendments to building law or labeling require-
ments for handsets.
Over the past few years, recognized expert organizations such as the 
World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Commission on 
Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) have repeatedly reviewed 
the current thresholds for mobile communications and confirmed that – 
if these values are complied with – the use of mobile technology is safe 
based on current scientific knowledge. The expert organizations, cur-
rently the ICNIRP, regularly review the recommended thresholds on the 
basis of the latest scientific findings.
We are convinced that mobile communications technology is safe if 
specific threshold values are complied with. We are supported in this 
conviction by the assessment of the recognized bodies. Our responsible 
approach to this issue is manifested in our Group-wide EMF Policy, with 
which we commit ourselves to more transparency, information, partici-
pation and financial support of independent mobile communications 
research, far beyond that which is stipulated by legal requirements. We 
aim to overcome uncertainty among the general public by pursuing an 
objective, scientifically well-founded and transparent information policy. 
We thus continue to see it as our duty to maintain our close and suc-
cessful dialog with local authorities, over and above the statutory 
requirements. This also applies since our longstanding collaboration 
with municipalities to expand the mobile network was enshrined in  
law in 2013; previously, this collaboration was based on voluntary self-
commitments by the network operators.

Almost half of the German population (48 percent) has been victim to 
Internet crime - for example through viruses, Trojans or computer 
worms. These were the findings of a survey conducted by TNS Emnid 
on behalf of Deutsche Telekom in February 2016. Few users – whether 
they are using the Internet for private or professional purposes – are 
aware that every click leaves behind data traces online that can poten-
tially be traced. Hackers can take advantage of this to collect specific 
data and identify vulnerabilities in hardware and software. Our custom-
ers' trust is the basis for our business as an ICT company, which is why 
data privacy and data security are of utmost importance to us.

ENSURING EFFECTIVE DATA PRIVACY 
The highest standards of data privacy and data security are core charac-
teristics of our brand identity. In 2008 we created a Board of Manage-
ment department for Data Privacy, Legal Affairs and Compliance as well 
as the Group Privacy unit. This has given us the necessary capacities for 
effective data protection. The responsible Board member is advised by 
the independent Data Privacy Advisory Board, which comprises 
renowned experts from politics, science, business and independent 
organizations. The Board was founded in February 2009.
At the beginning of 2017 the new Telekom Security business unit com-
menced operations. The new unit combines the security activities from 
various Group areas, thereby reinforcing our portfolio of cyber security 
solutions.
We are also committed to improving the political framework conditions 
to ensure comprehensive data privacy. At the 2015 national IT summit 
we signed the "Charter for the Promotion of Trustworthy Communica-
tions" together with the German Federal Minister of the Interior and 
other organizations. Its main purpose is to make sure that the encryp-
tion of private communication becomes standard.
Consistent transparency toward the public
In 2008 we were the first DAX-30 company to publish an annual data 
privacy report. In 2016, we decided to stop publishing this report and 
instead provide the relevant information on the Internet at 
www.telekom.com/en/corporate-responsibility/data-protection-data-
security/data-protection, where we now provide up-to-date and impor-
tant information about developments related to data protection and 
secure handling of personal data.
Since 2014, we have also been publishing an annual transparency 
report. In the report we disclose our obligations to cooperate with 
German and international security agencies.
The section on protecting consumers and minors elaborates on how 
we ensure the safety of our products and services.
Regular employee training courses
Telecommunications companies are obliged to provide new employees 
with information on data privacy regulations. We go above and beyond 
these legal requirements. Every two years, we train all of our employees 
in Germany and commit them to data privacy and telecommunications 
secrecy. Corresponding requirements for our national companies are in 
place. We have also introduced specific training in the customer and 
human resources departments, where the risk of data abuse is higher. 
This training includes online courses for independent learning, presen-
tations on data privacy and face-to-face courses on specific topics such 
as data protection at call centers. This helps us make sure that all 
employees have in-depth understanding of the relevant data privacy pol-
icies.
Annual review of measures through audits and certifications
We conduct an annual Group data privacy audit to measure and 
improve the general data privacy standards throughout the Group. 30 
percent of the Group employees, who are randomly selected, are asked 
to participate in an online survey. The Group data privacy audit is sup-
plemented by self-assessments completed by the data privacy officers 
at the national companies on implementation of the requirements 
defined in our "Binding Corporate Rules on Privacy."
Based on the results, the Group Privacy department identifies need for 
action at the respective departments and requires them to implement 
improvement measures. To this end, the Global Data Privacy Officer 
holds personal meetings with the responsible directors, managers and 
data privacy officers at the different departments. The Group Privacy 
department supports implementation of the improvement measures by 
providing information and advice and conducts a follow-up evaluation. 
Unusual audit results are taken into consideration when planning the 
follow-up audit.

We also have our processes and management systems as well as prod-

as TÜV, DEKRA and auditing firms. The technical services company 
TÜV Nord confirmed once again this year that Deutsche Telekom's IT 
systems are secure.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU GENERAL DATA PROTECTION 
REGULATION
The EU General Data Protection Regulation took effect in May 2016. 
After a two-year transition period, the regulation will be binding as of 
May 25, 2018. Since laws always require interpretation as to how they 
should be implemented in day-to-day life, the Group Privacy department 
has now prepared uniform rules for the entire Group: the Binding Inter-
pretations. They were compiled in collaboration with data privacy 
experts in the national companies. The Binding Interpretations include 
specific recommendations and best practice examples to implement 
the EU regulation. For example, they explain what a customer consent 
must entail, or how customer data has to be deleted, if this is requested 
by the customer. Over the next few years, we will be collecting further 
practical experience and further developing these interpretations. Our 
data privacy training will also be adapted to include the new content.
PUBLICATION OF INTERNATIONAL TRANSPARENCY REPORT
Telecommunications companies are legally obligated to cooperate 
with security agencies. This includes surveillance measures to record 
telecommunications connections or disclosure of customer information. 
Deutsche Telekom has been publishing an annual transparency report 
for Germany since 2014, which covers the types and amount of informa-
tion we disclose to security agencies. The transparency report was 
expanded to include all the national companies in 2016. The interna-
tional transparency report was last published in February 2017.
International legal framework conditions differ considerably. In some 
countries it is illegal to disclose security measures, while in others  
surveillance is directly conducted by the authorities without the 
involvement of telecommunications companies. You can find more 
information on the local situations in the various country reports at  
www.telekom.com/transparency-report.
We consider it the responsibility of the authorities to ensure transpar-
ency regarding security measures and called for improved online secu-
rity in the context of a ten-point program in January 2015. Until our 
requests are met, we strive to provide the necessary transparency 
within the legal possibilities.

ENSURING EXCELLENT SERVICE QUALITY
We want to offer a reliable, high-quality service that satisfies all of our 
customers. In order to achieve this goal, we reoriented our customer 
service in 2017 and combined our customer service and technical ser-
vice. This will enable optimal coordination and alignment of our service 
processes from beginning to end - from the initial contact with the hot-
line to problem resolution.
Our landline and mobile communications customers have been able to 
reach us around the clock in Germany since 2013 using our service 
numbers, including for Internet and TV questions. Our online channels 
are becoming more and more important. More than 40 percent of all 
service inquiries at Telekom Deutschland are solved by support pro-
vided by our overarching online platforms (as of the end of 2017). In 
order to improve convenience for our customers when they have service 
questions, we expanded our digital offering with new functions in 2017. 
For example, you can now arrange the relocation of a line using an app 
or track the arrival of a Deutsche Telekom technician.
Measuring customer loyalty and willingness to recommendour 
products and services to others
We use the TRI*M index to precisely gauge customer loyalty and regu-
larly participate in benchmarkings. The basis for the census is a cus-
tomer survey in all markets where we are active. The benefit for the 
Deutsche Telekom Group consists in data aggregation across all coun-
try values, excluding the USA. The index itself is calculated from four 
individual issues (competitive edge, performance, continued use and 
recommendation). In the 2017 reporting year the Group-wide TRI*M 
was 68.6points compared to the previous year's value of 70.2. The 
TRI*M index for Germany was 59 points, compared to the previous 
year's 60 points. That means we didn't attain our goal of a slight 
increase. One of the reasons for this is that our service provision for 
business customers was deemed to be capable of improvement. Our 
goal for 2018 is to increase this number by at least one point. The 
TRI*M index for consumers in Germany was 57 points in 2017 com-
pared to 59 points the previous year. This result was three points below 
expectations. We were able to again improve our customers' willingness 
to recommend us in 2017 compared to the previous year, adding 
another 0.04 points for a score of 7.40 points.
The results for our customers' satisfaction and loyalty are in part tied to 
our managers' variable salary components and thus play a role in their 
performance assessments.
NEW SERVICE ORIENTATION: DOING EVEN MORE TO MEET 
OUR CUSTOMERS' NEEDS
We took another important step in 2017 with our service reorientation 
in order to create a service that is oriented to our customers from A to Z. 
To this end, we merged our customer service and technical service. 
Some 36,000 Telekom employees are now part of our service unit.
Our focus is on the needs of our customers. We are simplifying our pro-
cesses and offer contact options, contact persons and solutions from 
one source. This is significantly aided by personal advisers who provide 
advice on relocations and changes of provider as well as by the per-
sonal callback service. For example, the personal callback service 
allows customers to speak with the same customer adviser within five 
days of the initial contact. Deutsche Telekom's voice portal logs the cus-
tomer's request for a callback and forwards it to the corresponding cus-
tomer adviser. The callback will then be initiated within one hour, and 
frequently sooner.
Our service reorientation is already showing initial success. Since 2017 
we've had about 20 percent more technicians available for customers. 
We also systematically evaluate our customers' inquiries and complaints 
to identify the root of the problem and make improvements.
Additional improvement measures planned for 2018
Our goal is to achieve a zero cancellation rate for appointments with our 
technicians. In cases where an appointment needs to be unexpectedly 
canceled nonetheless, the customer will be promptly informed of this 
and a new appointment will be scheduled. We will also be gradually 
shortening the appointment time frame. This will prevent customers 
from having to keep entire days free for the technician's appointment.
In order to improve quality and increase efficiency even more, we want 
to prevent empty trips in the field and continue to increase instances 
where issues are resolved during initial contact. We want to wow our 
customers with our service – and not only during the problem resolution 
process but a lot earlier, if possible.

OUR INNOVATIONS FOR BETTER SERVICE
We want to improve our service continuously and on all channels:  
personal, by telephone, online and via app. In addition to improving 
existing contact channels, we are also working on innovative new  
service offers.
 
In order to improve our "classic" phone service, we have been offer-
ing an alternative to the hotline waiting queue since March 2017, at 
the request of our customers. Callers can request a callback if the 
wait times are very long. 
 
Many online services can also be used via the MagentaSERVICE 
app. It combines our entire service offering for mobile communica-
tions and landline customers, allowing our customers to do things 
such as check their data usage or manage their contracts, for exam-
ple. In 2017 we expanded the app with a range of functions. A line 
relocation can now be arranged without having to personally con-
tact customer service, for example. What's more, customers who 
want to make an appointment can use the app to find the nearest 
Telekom Shop. 
 
Our digital incident assistant – an automated text chat that can 
engage in text-based dialog with customers – was refined in 2017 to 
become a digital service assistant. It is now able to automatically 
answer questions about cables, installation and incidents with 
regard to telephony, Internet and TV. In addition to providing infor-
mation about technical topics, the digital service assistant can now 
also tackle questions about e-mail, WLAN and smartphones. At IFA 
2017, we presented, by way of live text chat, the newly added possi-
bility of being forwarded to a customer adviser if the chatbot is una-
ble to definitively resolve the issue. 
 
At the end of 2017 we launched the Arrival Control service, whereby 
the customer receives a link to a website via text message where he/
she can track a technician's process steps until their appointment 
with said technician. For example, the customer can see whether 
the technician is still with the prior customer and when he/she is 
scheduled to arrive. 
AWARDS FOR OUR SERVICE
TÜV Rheinland: a "good" rating for Deutsche Telekom’s service 
For the fifth time in a row, the TÜV-Rheinland awarded Deutsche

EXPANDING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE 
The data volume generated globally will increase tenfold by 2020 com-
pared to 2013, according to a study conducted by US-based IT com-
pany EMC. That would mean 44 billion gigabytes in the networks a year 
instead of 4.4 billion. The amount of digital data being produced in 
Germany alone is expected to grow from a current 230 billion gigabytes 
to 1,100 billion. Networks need to be continually expanded to be able to 
handle this volume.
We have been the largest investor in this area in Germany for years now 
and will continue to drive network expansion. The main objectives of 
our pan-European integrated network strategy (INS) form the basis for 
these activities: growth, efficiency and quality. We will continue to 
expand our networks, increase the efficiency of our systems and further 
strengthen our role as a leader in network quality. Our integrated net-
work strategy is in line with the network expansion goals specified by 
the EU Commission and the German federal government (digital 
agenda and broadband strategy).
Deutsche Telekom's integrated network strategy (INS) for Europe is 
based on the four pillars of LTE, fiber optics, VDSL vectoring and hybrid. 
In addition to expanding the LTE mobile network, fiber-optic expansion 
in combination with VDSL vectoring technology is the short and 
medium-term focus of Deutsche Telekom's INS for Germany.
We have defined two targets in implementing our INS in Germany that 
we plan to have achieved by 2018. One, we expect to be able to provide 
95 percent of the population with LTE. Secondly, progress of the fiber-
optic network roll-out should allow VDSL vectoring lines with band-
widths of at least 50 Mbit/s for around 80 percent of all households 
in 2018/9. This is subject to regulatory changes.
Upgrading our network architecture
We intend to make our networks faster and more efficient. To do this, we 
are going to deactivate all analog PSTN (public switched telephone net-
work) platforms that we no longer need and switch our entire telephone 
network to IP-based lines.
We will also rely on fiber optics when updating our network architecture 
in order to meet our customers' demands for fast network connections. 
Using the fiber optic-based VDSL vectoring technology speeds up 
download data transmission rates to up to 100 Mbit/s and even up to 
40 Mbit/s when it comes to upload transmission rates. But vectoring 
requires more energy. In order to lower this consumption, we are work-
ing on control solutions for the energy-saving operation of our facilities. 
The combination of IP technology and VDSL vectoring is already con-
siderably more energy-efficient than conventional PSTN technology.
Irrespective of the expansion and renewal of our infrastructure, we 
aim to operate our networks in the most stable and failure-free manner 
possible.
NEW COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD: NETWORK REVOLUTION 
INSTEAD OF EVOLUTION
The current LTE communications standard is a fourth generation stand-
ard (4G). LTE is continually developing and can fully meet the require-
ments of consumers for ever greater bandwidth. We assume that the 4G 
LTE technology will most likely also become a foundation for a future 
5G standard. 5G is currently being discussed and developed in the 
industry. This will allow us to meet the growing requirements of consum-
ers in the future as well.
However, 5G will be able to do much more - the new functions will be 
interesting first and foremost for industry. That's because 5G will enable 
new business models which are still inconceivable according to current 
standards. This includes innovative solutions for the healthcare sector 
and automotive industry. All in all, 5G will provide 1,000 times higher 
capacity depending on the application, 10 times better speed and 10 
times faster response time (latency) in comparison with conventional 
technologies.

Advances on the road to 5G
 
We made further progress with respect to response time in the 5G 
network in 2017. After we cracked the record latency of one milli-
second in 2016, we are now also able to guarantee stable low 
response times in the 5G network. Industrial applications that rely 
on a high degree of precision in particular need this reliability. At the 
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February 2017, we demon-
strated this using an industrial robot whose response times were 
always exactly eight milliseconds.
 
We were able to prove the industrial sustainability of 5G and the 
advantages for the energy sector in another practical test in the 
spring of 2017. In cooperation with the Berlin-based electricity sup-
plier Stromnetz Berlin and telecommunications company Ericsson, 
we investigated use cases in the electricity grid within the scope of 
the 5Grid project. The results showed that highly flexible communi-
cations networks will soon be available with 5G, which can adapt to 
the most varied of requirements. Such electricity grids are needed 
for the shift towards wind and solar energy. 5G can thus become a 
key driving force behind the energy revolution in Europe.
 
Together with Ericsson and South Korean telecommunications com-
pany SK Telecom, we developed the first intercontinental 5G trial 
network in the world and presented it in the spring of 2017. To this 
end, we set up what is called network slices (virtual networks) for 
Deutsche Telekom and SK Telecom in the regions where the two 
network operators operate. Network slicing enables an operator to 
offer a network service internationally. Customers would then not 
need to conclude individual contracts with operators in various 
countries. Both companies demonstrated this in a test run, during 
which they set up network slices for, among other things, aug-
mented reality (AR) which allows an augmented perception of reality 
– for example through smartphones.
 
In September we used the new mobile communications standard 
5G New Radio (NR), the future mobile communications component 
of 5G, for the first time throughout Europe. In Berlin-Schöneberg our 
network transmitted data over a 5G connection with more than two 
gigabits per second and a latency of three milliseconds during a 
field test. This represents an important development step on the 
road to the worldwide introduction of 5G.
CONTINUING EXPANSION OF THE FIBER-OPTIC NETWORK
Telekom already operates the largest fiber-optic network in Europe
 with a length of 455,000 kilometers. However, demand for higher band-
widths is constantly increasing. In view of this trend, we continue to 
expand our fiber-optic network in order to secure our business success 
in the long term. Our goal is to provide 80 percent of Germany's popula-
tion with a minimum of 50 Mbit/s by 2018/2019 – subject to regulatory 
changes.
To reach this goal, we are using FTTC (fiber to the curb) technology and 
are expanding FTTH (fiber to the home) as well. In the scope of the 
FTTC expansion, fiber optics are laid to the gray street cabinets on the 
curb. From there we can supply our customers with large bandwidths 
via existing lines by means of VDSL vectoring. With FTTH, the fiber-optic 
cables are really taken into the customer’s home.

Vectoring compensates for electromagnetic interference that arises 
between the copper lines on the way to the customer's home. The tech-
nology allows for faster data transmission with speeds of up to 100 
Mbit/s. The technology for this is installed in cable distribution boxes.
In October 2017, we switched the first two of 7,600 nearshore areas in 
Germany to fast vectoring: Moitin near Rostock and Bad Grund in the 
Harz region. Nearshore areas are households that are supplied over 
street cabinets at a distance of at most 550 meters from the main distri-
bution frame (the central service installation for households and compa-
nies in the area). The German Federal Network Agency decided in 2016 
to approve vectoring expansion in the vicinity of Deutsche Telekom's 
main distribution frames (nearshore vectoring).
CONTINUING EXPANSION OF THE LTE MOBILE NETWORK
We continued to expand our use of LTE mobile network technology 
in the Deutsche Telekom network throughout Europe in 2017. In late 
2017, average network coverage was at 94 percent of the population, 
putting our European national companies in line with their target cover-
age. Network coverage at the end of 2017 was around 93 percent of the 
German population. Our goal is to achieve 95 percent by the end of 
2018. Around 75 percent of European transmitter masts are currently 
equipped with LTE. Two or more frequency bands are active in almost 
every fourth LTE location, ensuring more extensive reach and higher 
speeds.
FASTER INTERNET ACCESS ON BOARD
Together with satellite operator Inmarsat, we are planning to provide 
airline passengers in Europe with even better Internet access on airline 
flights. We are currently establishing the European Aviation Network 
(EAN) within the scope of a strategic partnership with additional part-
ners. EAN is the first integrated solution worldwide that consists of a 
satellite and a complementary LTE-based ground network. Other part-
ners are telecommunications company Nokia and aerospace specialist 
Thales.
Deutsche Telekom and Nokia completed the project's ground network 
at the start of 2018. To this end, 300 antenna locations were installed 
and the network was connected live. At the same time, Inmarsat and 
Thales advanced the satellite communication for the EAN. The satellite 
was launched in the summer of 2017 and has completed its tests in 
orbit in the meantime. Now it's ready to support on-board Internet ser-
vices.
The EAN service has been functional since the end of 2017 after com-
pleting successful flight tests. Our first customer, airline group IAG, has 
already equipped multiple airplanes with EAN hardware and launched 
an internal pilot project. The EAN service is slated to be commercially 
available for passengers starting in the summer of 2018. The European-
wide introduction of EAN for the entire IAG fleet will take place in 2019.

PAN-EUROPEAN NETWORK (PAN-NET) IS TAKING SHAP
To date, our European national companies have operated their own 
infrastructures and developed their services independently. However, 
the switch to IP technology – to be largely completed by 2018 - will 
make it possible to develop new services together and share them 
across borders. We hope to tap into this potential by creating a pan-
European network.
Individual services such as text messages, voicemails and e-mails will 
be made available to all countries in the pan-European network as 
"product building blocks." Our Pan-Net cloud will serve as the basis for 
this. Every national company can then use the building blocks to create 
an offer that suits their local market and customer requirements. We 
can also use this technology to offer new solutions throughout Europe 
within just a few days.
The Pan-Net cloud is an association of data centers distributed through-
out Europe. After we started up operations in the first of these data cent-
ers in Hungary in 2016, another center followed in Poland in 2017. 
Greece should be added to this list at the end of 2018. We founded a 
new company for management and control of the new infrastructure in 
2015: Deutsche Telekom Pan-Net, headquartered in Slovakia.
SWITCH TO IP TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES
Thanks to IP technology, phone calls are no longer transmitted via 
analog channels or using ISDN technology but in the form of data pack-
ets over the secure Deutsche Telekom network, a method that has been 
the standard in online and mobile communications services for some 
time now. The switch to IP-based lines is the basis for faster Internet 
connections. At the same time, energy use with IP technology is consid-
erably lower than with the network technology previously used. The 
switch therefore also helps us decrease our CO2 emissions
By the end of 2017 we had switched about 16.5 million lines in Ger-
many, that is around 69 percent, to IP. We continue to convert about 
70,000 connections every week. After placing our focus on consumer 
lines for some time, we began increasingly focusing on business cus-
tomers in 2016. The IP rate for business customer lines was significantly 
more than 50 percent by the end of 2017. Thanks to the use of IP-based 
vectoring technology, 3.5 million households in almost 50 cities could 
surf the Internet with up to 100 MBit/s by the end of 2017.
In the other EU countries we also increased the number of IP lines. In 
Croatia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Slovakia, all lines have already 
been switched to IP. Hungary followed at the end of 2017. The plan is to 
complete the switch in Greece and Romania by 2018.
AWARD FOR MOBILE NETWORK IN GERMANY
TÜV NORD confirms that Deutsche Telekom offers the best mobile 
telecommunications network quality
Instead of a testing snapshot, as is common to 
most tests, we have had the quality of our net-
work tested throughout the year for years now. 
Testing vehicles record measurement data for 
speech and data services as part of continuous 
testing. They record the network quality, also 
compared to our competitors’ mobile communications networks. This is 
done to ensure more transparency. The result is that we rank the best in 
the categories of call set-up, call stability and voice quality.
The professionals at TÜV NORD CERT extensively tested the "quality 
comparison from the customer's perspective" process (QCCP). They 
confirm the neutrality of the recording and processing of test data and 
have issued the TÜV Service Check certificate for the "Test and Evalua-
tion Process according to QCCP Standard" without restrictions.
Deutsche Telecom receives multiple awards as best mobile 
communications operator
Stiftung Warentest (edition: 06/2017)
The consumer organization Stiftung Warentest 
once again confirmed in 2017 that Deutsche  
Telekom has the best mobile communications 
network in Germany. Stiftung Warentest tested the 
networks in Germany on freeways, highways and 
in city centers. Our performance was the best, with an overall rating of 
1.9 (good). A Telekom LTE signal could be obtained in 97 percent of the 
test regions in rural areas.

We can also use our products, services, and activities to participate in 
contributing to ecological and social challenges, as was made clear in 
a comparison with the 17 sustainability goals (SDGs) set forth by the 
United Nations. That's because information and communications tech-
nology (ICT) allows industries, service providers and consumers to be 
more sustainable. By way of example, according to the GeSI 
#SMARTer2030 study, greenhouse emissions could be reduced by 
20 percent by 2030 through targeted use of ICT. Furthermore, ICT also 
offers great market potential: The study estimates that $6.5 trillion of 
additional revenues will flow from ICT-enabled services in 2030. Sus-
tainability not only involves protecting the environment but also has 
further relevance when it comes to ICT. Technology can contribute to 
reduced resource consumption, for example. Within the scope of the 
"Smart City" projects, i.e. the implementation of digital technology in 
cities, it can help reduce traffic or improve traffic flow, and hence 
reduce emissions, for example through Parking Apps, or make street 
lighting more energy-efficient.
But ICT can do even more. It is also the precondition for sustainable 
economies. In our current consumer model, products are usually 
discarded after use. This leads to the loss of valuable resources while 
garbage piles grow.  The idea of a circular economy, where resources 
return to the production process through recycling, offers a promising 
solution. The idea of a shared economy goes a step further than this. 
This is a "share instead of own" concept, which reduces the amount of 
consumer goods per person. What's more, repairing objects increases 
their life cycle. Both save valuable resources. Many shared economy 
concepts like car sharing or city bikes wouldn't even be possible with-
out digital networking. 
As a telecom company, we are doing our part to decrease resource 
consumption of ICT products. In our leasing model for routers and 
media receivers discarded devices are refurbished for reuse. This 
extends their life cycle. And with our cell phone collection program, 
we make sure that valuable resources are returned to the value chain. 
Thanks to solutions like cloud computing our customers can also do 
without their own servers, thereby conserving resources.
In addition, ICT helps stabilize electricity networks, simplify workflows 
and further improve medical care.
As a modern technology company, we want to help shape the develop-
ment of products and services that contribute to sustainability. That is 
why we continuously expand our offer of sustainable products and inno-
vative ICT solutions for private and business customers.

DEVELOPING SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
We are committed to systematically using the sustainability potential 
of ICT. Our primary focus in these efforts is on machine2machine com-
munication, smart home technology and e-health. Sustainable products 
are also an important pillar of our integrated climate strategy.
Managing the issue of sustainable products calls for systematic meas-
ures to be implemented throughout the supply chain. Thus, our meas-
ures already start with procurement. This is how we make sure that sus-
tainability criteria are complied with along our supply chain. We aim to 
have our products certified by recognized environmental labels such as 
the Blue Angel and the TÜV "Certified Green Product“ label. The strict 
requirements of these labels help us see how we can further improve 
our products. They also help us inform our customers of the benefits of 
choosing sustainable products. At the end of a product's life cycle, we 
contribute to its reuse or recycling. For example, we regularly carry out 
used cell phone collection campaigns.
Sustainable solutions for today and tomorrow
Our services contribute to the increasing digitization of workflows and 
business processes, resulting in decreased consumption of resources. 
Some examples of this are our cloud computing offers, which eliminate 
our customers' need for their own servers and storage media. At the 
same time, we want to give as many people as possible the chance to 
participate in the information society and to use the opportunities it 
offers. We facilitate use of modern communication media for people 
with age-related or physical disabilities, for example. We develop prod-
ucts and services that meet their needs and continue to work on improv-
ing user friendliness. Throughout the Group, Deutsche Telekom also 
offers various subsidized rates to provide low-income customers and 
people with disabilities with cost-efficient phone and data rate plans.
When developing new, sustainable ICT solutions, we also cooperate 
with various partners and communicate with our stakeholders.
We are always thinking one step ahead in everything we do. We aim 
to develop new solutions primarily through innovation cooperations. 
In addition, we invest in extensive research, for example in the field of 
machine2machine communication. We invested a total of 57.7 million 
euros in research and development throughout the Group in 2017. We 
also finance professorships, collaborate with universities and encour-
age innovative business concepts with our start-up incubator, hub:raum.

Making progress measurable
We measure our progress by means of various KPIs. For example, we 
use the Sustainable Revenue Share ESG KPI to measure the share in 
sales of products and services that are classified as sustainable based 
on a risk-benefit analysis. In 2017, 40 percent of our overall sales in Ger-
many and Europe was generated with such products. We have defined 
performance goals, e.g., sales goals, as internal monitoring tools in cer-
tain fields such as e-health and Smart Home. We measure the impact 
of our collection campaigns with our Used Cell Phone  
Collection ESG KPI. 
CONTINUED ANALYSIS OF THE SUSTAINABILITY BENEFITS  
OF OUR PRODUCTS
One building block of our integrated climate strategy is to analyze the 
sustainability benefits of our product portfolio. In 2014 we began ana-
lyzing our portfolio together with external experts based on sustainabil-
ity criteria (analysis). We measure the result with the Sustainable Reve-
nue Share ESG KPI. The share of such products was already at 40 per-
cent in 2017 (excluding T-Mobile US).
40% of revenue with products and services that offer sustainability 
benefits
Examples of sustainability benefits include reduced CO2 emissions 
thanks to virtual meetings instead of business trips, improved medical 
care by means of e-health solutions and resource conservation by 
replacing physical devices with digital solutions (e.g. phoning via a  
laptop instead of a fixed-line phone).
Overall, we have carried out in-depth analyses for 17 product groups 
with regard to their sustainability benefits and the corresponding busi-
ness potential (as of year-end 2017). We have illustrated the benefits  
of some selected products based on all three pillars of sustainability 
(ecological, social and economic).

To date, there is no industry-wide established system that provides cus-
tomers with sustainability information about ICT products and services. 
We have started to create just such a system using our product analyses 
– that is, to find out which sustainability contributions our products can 
make at all. Future plans also include keeping our customers better 
informed of these sustainability benefits, thereby sharpening our com-
petitive edge.
PILOT PROJECT FOR ANALYZING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR 
PRODUCTS
Studies such as GeSI #SMARTer2030 show that information and com-
munication technology solutions (ICT) can make an important contribu-
tion to sustainable development. Many of our products offer economic 
as well as social and ecological benefits. Quantifying this added value 
and hence making it measurable is a challenge, since many of the 
social benefits of our products are only indirect. But we are tackling 
this challenge and testing various approaches. In addition to building 
a sustainable product portfolio, we have been participating since 2015 
in the industry-wide Sustainability Assessment Framework (SASF) pilot 
project conducted by the Global e-Sustainability Initiative. The goal of 
this project is to develop a tool that can be used to evaluate a large vari-
ety of ICT products based on their sustainability. The results will also 
help determine sustainability risks along the value chain. The SASF 
evaluation criteria are not limited to environmental aspects but also 
include social criteria such as compliance with human rights and cus-
tomer requirements such as cost transparency and data protection. 
With this comprehensive approach, SASF is setting new standards for 
product evaluation in the ICT sector.
We have been contributing to the development of SASF since the begin-
ning and took part in the pilot study – an initial hands-on test – in 2016. 
In 2017 we began testing whether and how SASF can be integrated into 
our management processes. We will be continuing this testing in 2018.
In addition, we also examine and evaluate other approaches for assess-
ing the sustainability benefits of our products and services.
PHASE 2 M2M COMMUNICATION: OPPORTUNITIES OF 
DIGITALIZATION
Machines and products are becoming increasingly intelligent. Cars 
can communicate with repair shops, containers with logistics service 
providers. The technology that makes this possible is called machine-
to-machine communication, or M2M. By 2020 the number of M2M 
connections around the world is expected to increase to 2.5 billion. 
Machine-to-machine communication is an important area of growth for 
us.
M2M can help ideally coordinate the processes of various devices, 
vehicles and entire industrial facilities. This helps increase industrial 
productivity, ensure efficient logistics, reduce energy consumption and 
conserve resources.
We also support the German federal government's Industry 4.0 initiative 
through our involvement in machine-to-machine communication. The 
initiative's objective is to maintain Germany's competitive edge in the 
technology sector.
New wireless technology allows for innovative applications
Our networks are the basis for a number of M2M applications, as mobile 
network technology is the key transmission channel of every M2M

connection. In this respect, the NarrowBand Internet of Things (NB-IoT) 
is gaining significance. As opposed to broadband applications, which 
enable transmission of large amounts of data, narrowband technology 
is specifically designed to reliably transfer very small data packages. 
Benefits of NB-IoT include its low energy requirements, extensive reach 
and low-cost device networking. NB-IoT is particularly suitable for use in 
logistics. When tracing transport containers, all that is needed is for the 
current position to be transferred about once an hour. Only very small 
amounts of data need to be transferred in small data packages – and 
not necessarily in real time. NB-IoT is even used for protecting biodiver-
sity, in a technology that beekeepers can use to protect their bees.
We were pioneers in aiding the development of uniform NB-IoT stand-
ards and continue to drive it. NB-IoT is now available in more than 600 
locations in Germany. More than 200 of our business customers in vari-
ous sectors use this technology (as of year-end 2017). We are also lead-
ers in the launch of NB-IoT in Europe and North America: we are already 
active in seven European markets and the USA with the technology. Our 
narrowband network should be available nationwide in the USA and in 
many European countries by the end of 2018.
The port of tomorrow
In 2017 we continued our involvement in the smartPORT logistics (SPL) 
pilot project for the port of Hamburg. The goal of the project is to 
improve HDV traffic flows at the port of Hamburg and in its vicinity. All 
relevant traffic and infrastructure data is collected and analyzed in real 
time for this purpose. Results can be used to inform users about waiting 
times, alternative routes or parking. The project is increasingly being 
integrated into commercial operation.
EU project AEOLIX: A platform for more efficient and climate-friendly 
logistics chains 
The port of Hamburg is a part of the EU project AEOLIX. The goal of this 
project is to build a new ICT platform that networks numerous, previ-
ously isolated individual logistics systems across the EU. At the same 
time, practical services will be developed and tried out in 11 European 
test zones. T-Systems is participating in test zone 1: Intermodal Logis-
tics in the Hamburg – Frankfurt Transportation Corridor. This zone will 
test a smartphone app that helps truck drivers drive in an ecologically 
responsible manner. Some 958,230 metric tons of CO2 could be spared 
in ongoing customer projects MAN Telematics and SchmitzCargoBull 
Telematics as well as in additional new projects (e.g. AEOLIX) by analyz-
ing driving profiles and ecodrive functions. The project will run until 
2019.
AUTOPILOT – autonomous driving services for more efficiency
The goal of the EU project AUTOPILOT is to test autopilot services on 
the market. This also includes self-driving cars in short-distance traffic, 
self-parking cars and real-time car sharing. Such solutions are particu-
larly efficient and environmentally friendly, resulting in an estimated 10 
percent fewer CO2 emissions as compared to conventional driving prac-
tices. The project will run from 2017 to 2019. Thereafter the services 
will be incorporated into regular operations. T-Systems is the 
project partner of AUTOPILOT and supports analyses on the feasibility 
and market launch of the new services.
Connected Car: Preventing traffic jams with connected cars
T-Systems has been developing and operating Daimler's Connected 
Car platform (Daimler vehicle backend) worldwide since 2013. The 
platform is the technical basis for the Live Traffic service, which provides 
drivers with real-time traffic information, thereby helping them avoid 
traffic jams. Live Traffic prevents about 30% of traffic jams per vehicle. 
This means that the approximately 5 million vehicles equipped with Live 
Traffic consumed about 6.2 million liters less fuel. This translates into 
CO2 savings of about 15,000 metric tons.
DEUTSCHE TELEKOM AND FRAUNHOFER IML INAUGURATE THE 
TELEKOM OPEN IOT LABS
Deutsche Telekom and the Fraunhofer Institute for Material Flow and 
Logistics (Fraunhofer IML), based in Dortmund, have founded the 
"Telekom Open IoT Labs". At the new facility, up to six scientists from 
Fraunhofer IML, and three IoT experts from Deutsche Telekom, will work 
together to develop and test Internet of Things (IoT) solutions and bring 
them to market maturity. The collaboration is aimed at optimizing pro-
cesses in the manufacturing, logistics and aviation sectors. The Labs 
will be open to other companies interested in collaborating with 
Deutsche Telekom and Fraunhofer to develop application-specific IoT 
prototypes. Telekom Open IoT Labs will thus add an industrial-IoT 
component to Deutsche Telekom's existing network of R&D facilities.
Prototypes for holistic IoT solutions
In a first step, the two partners will work jointly with interested compa-
nies to identify requirements for IoT solutions. They will then design and 
create relevant applications, developing and producing hardware, soft-
ware and connectivity prototypes. Efforts will be concentrated on pro-
ducing solutions that can later be launched for mass-market use. In 
work carried out to date in cooperation with Würth Industrie Service, for 
example, a prototype of a service button for the area of C-parts manage-
ment was developed. This service button will optimize the reordering 
process for "C parts" such as screws, nuts and washers by applying nar-
rowband IoT (NB-IoT) technology.
Paving the way with NB-IoT
Initially, the Deutsche Telekom / Fraunhofer team plans to concentrate 
on solutions based on NB-IoT radio technology. That technology is emi-
nently suited for IoT applications in logistics, for example. The logistics 
sector has been digitalizing especially rapidly, because its companies 
have numerous business processes for which IoT solutions can provide 
significant added value in the short term. Logistics companies are using 
digital technologies to enhance transparency in their supply chains, as 
well as precision and efficiency in control of ship, rail and truck trans-
ports, and of their internal material flows.

Deutsche Telekom is already offering NB-IoT commercially throughout 
all of Germany. The Group also has a complete-coverage NB-IoT 
network in place in the Netherlands. In other European markets, such 
as Austria, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, 
Deutsche Telekom is expanding the existing coverage to additional 
cities.
SMART CITIES: INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR SMART URBAN 
SPACES
The majority of the worldwide CO2 emissions come from cities – an 
effect that is being intensified by increasing urbanization. At the same 
time, cities can also be the driving force behind and the origin of sus-
tainable solutions. Deutsche Telekom wants to use innovative solutions 
to help bring about sustainable transformation of cities. Some examples 
of this are intelligent, energy-saving street lights and connected waste 
containers that measure their fill level and report this to the public utility 
company. In order to bundle these approaches, we opened a European 
Smart Solutions Center (ESC) headquartered in Budapest in 2017. The 
ESC advises cities on the use of EU funding and develops Smart City 
solutions and platforms. What's more, we participate in numerous inter-
national projects on this subject. We have already installed Smart City 
solutions in 18 cities in 10 European countries.
mySMARTLife in Hamburg
The city of Hamburg, together with the cities of Nantes and Helsinki, 
were awarded the EU lighthouse project mySMARTLife in 2016. 
Numerous measures intended to launch the Smart City transformation 
are slated to be implemented by 2021.
The core topics of these lighthouse projects are increased use of renew-
able energies, climate-friendly living and environmentally friendly mobil-
ity. For example, use of electric vehicles will be promoted in the Ham-
burg-Bergedorf project region. Intelligent street lighting will also be 
employed. All projects involve active citizen participation. The Hamburg 
project proposal was backed by a total of 14 partners, including the bor-
ough of Bergedorf, HafenCity University, the HAW Hamburg university 
of applied sciences, electricity grid operator Stromnetz Hamburg, public 
transport operator Verkehrsbetriebe Hamburg-Schleswig-Holstein and 
Volkswagen. The project is subsidized as part of the European Union's 
Horizon2020 research and innovation program. The project results will 
be compared to other lighthouse projects in the EU. The project will 
also examine which measures can be implemented in the next 
mySMARTLife project cities – Varna (Bulgaria), Bydgoszcz (Poland), 
Rijeka (Croatia) and Palencia (Spain).
Kick-off for Smart City Bonn
Bonn was added to the Smart City project as another partner city during 
the reporting period. In November 2017, we began connecting street 
lighting and waste containers with intelligent sensors and measuring air 
quality.
The street lamps can now be dimmed and, with the help of motion 
sensors, automatically become brighter when pedestrians approach. 
The public utility company is also notified when a bulb is damaged or 
needs to be replaced. This technology saves up to 60 percent of the 
street lamps' operating costs. Additionally, we measure the fill level in a 
number of recycling containers using installed sensors. The municipal 
garbage service need not come for the container until it is actually full. 
Another sensor measures the air quality of the inner city. We also pro-
vide the associated analysis software.
PARK AND JOY – Digital park management
Preventing traffic jams and reducing CO2 emissions – these goals pose 
major challenges to cities and communities. Digital applications can be 
of help here, as they can be used to improve traffic flows and lower 
harmful emissions with a small amount of administrative effort. One 
example of this is the PARK AND JOY app, which we launched in Ham-
burg in October 2017. Some 100 parking spaces have been equipped 
with sensors there, and the plan is for this figure to increase to 11,000 
within the entire inner city area by the end of 2019. This will allow the 
app to immediately show drivers where there are empty parking spaces 
and navigate them to the exact spot. What's more, users can directly pay 
their parking fee using the application. PARK AND JOY can be down-
loaded for free in app stores. Bonn, Duisburg, Dortmund, Darmstadt 
and Moers are also planning to introduce PARK AND JOY in 2018.
Hackathon: Idea competition on life in the city
Implementing ideas for a liveable city of the future – that was the topic 
of Hackathon: Smart Public Life in the fall of 2017 in Bonn. A total of 
220 developers, designers and concept developers from 10 countries 
took part in the competition in small teams, including both profession-
als and amateurs. Their task was to implement their own program idea 
within 24 hours by using the potential of the Internet-of-Things to create 
a liveable, smart city of the future. The Hackathon was a great opportu-
nity to make new contacts and enhance skills. The best teams were 
given the chance to refine their project idea later on in the Telekom 
Incubator.
Navigation stick for the visually impaired in Czech Republic
As a socially responsible company, T-Mobile Czech Republic aims to 
support visually impaired people. We have been cooperating with the 
Czech Technical University to develop a unique navigation solution for 
the blind. Connecting up global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) 
and wireless data transfer networks has created one of the most 
advanced orientation solutions for visually impaired people. T-Mobile 
Czech Republic has supported the development of this navigation 
solution by providing connectivity in 3G and 4G, data SIM cards and 
modems. The newly developed navigation stick for blind people is con-
nected to a smartphone and the navigation center. Based on a 2G-4G 
app, the service enables navigation data, voice communication and 
images to be transferred. It also utilizes a camera for orientation in build-
ings where GNSS does not work. A testing phase was completed in 
2017. After a redesign and various improvements, a complete prototype 
of a new-generation stick has been completed. This new improved stick 
is being tested in 2018. We plan to launch the product at the end of the 
year.
Smart Cities in Croatia
In May 2017, Hrvatski Telekom installed the first smart payphones in 
the Croatian city of Zadar. The payphones are intended to provide all 
the local information required by citizens and the increasing number of 
tourists, while they are simultaneously given a broad range of next-gen-
eration innovative ICT services. The solution provided by the Croatian 
Postal Bank enables citizens to pay securely using their credit and debit 
cards.The City of Rijeka, in partnership with Ericsson Nikola Tesla, 
Hrvatski Telekom, Smart RI, Autotrolej and Rijeka promet installed two 
smart bus stops for Rijeka's citizens and numerous tourists. The smart 
stops offer a range of functionalities for a more efficient and enjoyable 
experience on city transport. They represent the world's technological 
breakthrough to the smart cities of the future.In collaboration with its 
partner EcoMobile, Hrvatski Telekom kicked-off a pilot-project for a

Smart Cities in Romania
In Bucharest, Romania, Telekom successfully rolled out the first inte-
grated Smart City project in 2016. It combined four technologies: smart 
parking, WiFi connectivity, city safety, and smart lighting, all integrated 
through an Internet of Things platform.
Telekom Romania launched a second Smart City project in Constanta, 
and a third one in Piatra Neamt, in 2017. The solutions are part of the 
“Smart Street” concept, and they address urban needs such as efficient 
lighting, public safety, internet access, efficient parking, and electrical 
recharging for cars. They also enable the municipalities to provide use-
ful information for citizens in real time, and to monitor environmental 
factors such as air quality.
A parking lot in Constanta with 50 places was equipped with sensors 
that allow drivers to track the availability of parking places in real time. 
In addition, the municipality can monitor the level of occupancy, and 
based on the statistics generated make an evidence-based decision on 
where parking lots should be supplemented.
The pilot project in Piatra Neamt foresees implementation of several 
innovative components, including a smart piece of street furniture. The 
solar-powered park bench will enable visitors at the park to charge their 
mobile devices and they can connect to the Wi-Fi internet services. As in 
Constanta, a Smart Lighting solution has been installed that offers the 
ability to reduce the light output according to predefined scenarios, 
resulting in lower energy consumption. The project also includes imple-
mentation of a station that charges two electric cars simultaneously.
INNOVATIVE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
LAUNCHED IN GREECE
In 2017, the OTE Group launched and developed several products and 
services to help customers improve their sustainability performance. 
The Group also successfully implemented some significant projects 
with the same objective. A number of examples are listed below:
Smart City Applications: Smart city applications were enriched by the 
OTE Group in 2017 so as to offer local communities the benefits of 
smart technologies. The Smart City portfolio includes applications for 
Parking, Lighting, Air Quality Monitoring, Waste Management, and 
Building Energy Management. Over the next two years, the OTE Group 
is also expanding its Narrowband IoT network which will cover 95% of 
the population. This will enable it to reinforce the use of smart city appli-
cations.
Chalkida is the first city in Greece to have a complex of smart pilot 
systems installed: Smart Parking, Smart Lighting, Air Quality and Waste 
Management, together with an integrated smart city platform. These 
applications will facilitate the process of finding parking spaces and 
contribute to decongesting traffic and reducing the city's energy con-
sumption. It will also provide useful information on air quality and opti-
mize waste collection. The project was conducted in 2017.
In 2017, COSMOTE was one of the first providers in Europe to imple-
ment the technology for the Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) in 
the city of Patras. This was a first in Greece and the Smart Parking, 
Smart Lighting and Air Quality solutions were installed at a selected 
location in the city center of Patras.
GRNET: The OTE Group provided the Greek Research and Technology 
Network (GRNET) with ICT solutions (data center and cloud infrastruc-
ture) so that 31 interconnected hospitals were able to offer more effi-
cient services to their patients and reduce operational costs. The project 
also helps the research community by allowing controlled and anony-
mous access to large volumes of imaging data to meet the needs of 
medical research.
Energy Management: The COSMOTE Energy Management service 
was implemented at several buildings in the Municipalities of Patras and 
Agios Dimitrios using remote intervention to monitor the energy con-
sumption at these buildings in real time. The service is expected to con-
tribute to protecting the environment, improving the quality of city life, 
and reducing operational costs.
After installing the service in five municipal buildings in the Municipality 
of Agios Dimitrios, the annual energy savings are estimated to be about 
66 MWh, and CO2 emissions are projected to be reduced by some 55 
metric tons.
e-Fuel Management Service: The e-Fuel Management service is an 
integrated solution, launched in 2017 by COSMOTE in order to offer 
monitoring of fuel consumption in corporate vehicles and hence reduce 
operating expenses.
DIGITAL HEALTH CARE: OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE BEST 
MEDICAL CARE
A uniform telehealth platform permits cross-case, standardized data 
sharing among healthcare providers. Telemedicine assistance systems 
can support patients and their families in everyday tasks, help bridge 
long distances to medical personnel and optimize the care process. 
We are helping shape the digital healthcare system with numerous pilot 
projects.
 
For example, we are involved in developing a solution for antibiotic 
treatment consultation at the St. Georg Hospital in Leipzig. The pri-
mary goal is to enable fast, secure data exchange between doctors, 
patients and health insurers. The State of Saxony sponsored the pro-
ject with over EUR 1.2 million at the beginning of 2017. It will run 
until mid-2019.
 
The Saxony Psychotraumatology Telemedicine Network is set to 
sustainably improve the integrated treatment chain for post-trau-
matic stress disorders and support digital mental health interven-
tions. Telematic communication and interoperability should support 
consultation and treatment early on and should, above all, be tai-
lored to the circumstances. The goal is to enable straightforward 
and location-independent access to the treatment network, make 
expertise universally available and guarantee cross-institution docu-
mentation and coordination of the healthcare process. The EU and 
the State of Saxony will be funding the innovative project, which will 
run until 2020, with EUR 1.4 million.

RAPID ENTRY INTO THE SMART HOME BUSINESS
We want to make it easy for companies – such as those in the tele-
communications or energy sector – to expand their core business with 
a Smart Home offer. To this end, we developed a special white label 
portfolio. It combines our open and secure Smart Home platform Qivi-
con, Smart Home gateways, apps, devices and services, based on 
which companies can offer Smart Home solutions to their customers. 
Business customers also have the option of offering our white label app 
under their own brand and customizing it. Consumers can easily and 
conveniently control the devices in their connected home using the app.
QIVICON – Our smart home platform
A smart home can make life easier for its occupants in many ways, 
allowing them to control and monitor various devices remotely – from 
security systems and home appliances to home electronics. Of course, 
one big challenge remains, in that a provider's smart home solution is 
often not compatible with the functions and devices of other manufac-
turers. That is why we have jointly set up the open, manufacturer-inde-
pendent smart home platform QIVICON. This platform gives consumers 
the option to combine devices made by different companies. More than 
40 partner companies and brands currently offer their solutions on the 
platform.
In 2017 we added solutions with Volkswagen and the ERGO Versi-
cherung insurance company, among others. Volkswagen owners can 
control their smart home directly using their car's infotainment system. 
And the ERGO emergency service will automatically initiate the neces-
sary measures in case of an emergency, such as a water pipe breaking, 
if the customer does not respond to the system's notification.
We were also able to further increase the number of devices that are 
compatible with the platform during the reporting period. Products by 
the companies Centralite and Sengled will give consumers a better 
selection of security and illumination options in the future. Even today 
our customers can choose from among more than 200 different smart 
home devices.
Security and data protection at QIVICON 
All communication via the QIVICON Home Base, which is connected to 
the Internet via servers, is encrypted. Any user data related to QIVICON 
is stored exclusively on our servers in Germany. All devices made by 
brands managed via QIVICON employ wireless technology based on 
state-of-the art security functions.
The Smart Home solution received ISO 9001 certification – the most 
widespread and most important quality management standard – during 
the reporting period. In addition, we commissioned the testing institute 
AV-TEST GmbH to check, for the third time, how secure the Qivicon 
Smart Home platform and the Magenta Smart Home app are. Once 
again, the rating was "very good protection".
Open platform
As a member of the Eclipse Foundation, one of the largest international 
open source communities, we are opening up the Qivicon platform to 
developers and start-ups. They will be able to use the platform to 
develop their own innovative smart home ideas.
Best Smart Home Network
We received the Best Smart Home Network award at the Broadband 
World Forum 2017. This award honors our smart home end-to-end solu-
tion and the hardware integration. Since September some 200,000 cus-
tomers received a free upgrade for their Speedport smart routers. By 
integrating the smart home functionalities into the router, they can con-
vert their own four walls into an intelligent home.
PROTECTING RESOURCES WITH CLOUD COMPUTING
With cloud computing, our customers no longer need to be bothered 
with their own servers and storage media. In most cases, cloud comput-
ing is more resource and energy-efficient than running your own infra-
structure outside of the cloud. Our data centers require up to 80 percent 
less energy thanks to more effective capacity utilization and less hard-
ware. We also continue to work on further improving the efficiency of 
our data centers.
The cloud for the public sector
For companies that want to convert their systems to cloud solutions, 
T-Systems offers a program called The Cloudifier. We analyze the cus-
tomer's IT landscape and identify which applications can be transferred 
to the cloud. Building on this, we developed the Cloudifier4Public in 
2017 – a service with which T-Systems designs and implements cus-
tomized cloud strategies for the public sector in Germany. Advice is tai-
lored to the objectives and particulars of German public administration. 
There are clear framework conditions in place for the development of 
cloud architectures with regard to data protection and information secu-
rity, safeguarding of statutory tasks and compliance with legal frame-
work conditions.
DON'T BUY, RENT
We want to make sure that used routers and media receivers don't 
just end up in the trash. That is why we promote the "Don't buy, rent" 
approach. Our rental services conserve resources, reduce electronic 
waste and prevent CO2 emissions. Customers return the devices if they 
cancel their contract. The devices are then either refurbished and 
rented out again or properly recycled. We have simplified the return 
process by introducing a returns portal. The online portal enables cus-
tomers to manage their own returns. We actively and effectively promote 
the rental service in many ways including at Telekom Shops, online, via 
customer service and in product flyers. The offer has been well received 
by our customers; the number of people using the rental service 
increased to around 9.5 million by the end of 2017.

PRODUCT CERTIFICATIONS: DEMONSTRABLY SUSTAINABLE
Sustainable products are a key factor in competition for us. In order to 
inform our customers about the sustainability benefits of our products, 
we rely on recognized ecolabels, such as the Blue Angel in Germany. 
The majority of fixed-line phones and some media receivers boast the 
Blue Angel label. In 2017 the Media Receiver Entry and the Media 
Receiver 201 also received the Blue Angel. End devices certified with 
this ecolabel also contain information for customers as to how the prod-
ucts can be used in an energy-efficient manner. In addition to the Blue 
Angel, we have also increasingly been using the TÜV Green Product 
Label. This label exceeds the Blue Angel criteria in ways such as requir-
ing inspections of working conditions at production sites. A number of 
our routers, including the Speedport Neo, have already been certified 
by the TÜV Green Product Label.In addition to ecological criteria, TÜV 
Green Product Label also provides for a review of working conditions 
in production plants.
The labels not only serve as information for our customers, however. 
Their strict requirements also help us see how we can further improve 
our products.
FAIRPHONE 2 AT T-MOBILE AUSTRIA 
T-MobileAustria is one of the first mobile network providers in the world 
and the only provider in Austria to combine a mobile contract with 
Fairphone2, the first sustainable and socially responsible smartphone. 
The company has been offering this product since early2016and it 
gives new and current customers an opportunity to choose a sustaina-
ble way of life when it comes to their smartphones.T-MobileAustria 
actively supports the Dutch company Fairphone in its efforts to raise 
awareness of fair electronics and promote responsibility in the industry. 
Fairphone focuses on four main challenges: to make mining at the 
beginning of the value chain, design, production and the product life 
cycle more sustainable and transparent. In order to achieve this goal the 
company cooperates with initiatives for the extraction of tin and tanta-
lum from conflict-free mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and 
sources conflict-free tungsten from Rwanda. It also created the first pilot 
supply chain for fair-trade gold in smartphones and promotes longevity 
through the modular product design of the Fairphone2.In order to facili-
tate long-term use of the product, spare parts for the Fairphone2can 
also be ordered viaT-MobileAustria.
USED CELL-PHONE COLLECTION IN GERMANY
Germany's recycling and reuse rate for small electronic appliances is 
too low. Too many used cell phones, smartphones and tablets are stuck 
in drawers or disposed of illegally with the household waste. But these 
devices should be refurbished and reused or properly recycled to help 
us conserve valuable resources. We have been offering different ways 
for people to hand in their devices since 2003. Customers have been 
able to return their used, high-end cell phones and smartphones to 
Telekom Shops under a buyback program since 2013. They receive 
store credit from the Telekom Shop reflecting their old device's current 
value, which they can use to purchase a new device, or they can choose 
to have the amount booked to their customer account. Business cus-
tomers can send in their used cell phones and smartphones through a 
buyback portal (www.handyankaufsportal.de) for business customers, 
which we created in 2016. After the device's value has been deter-
mined, the amount can be paid out or donated to a charitable organiza-
tion. Together with company Teqcycle Solutions we also operate the 
Cell Phone Collection Center online portal. Through this portal, authori-
ties, associations and other organizations have the opportunity to start 
collection campaigns for donating used cell phones and smartphones. 
The website provides an overview of these partners and the collection 
campaigns they conduct. Such campaigns took place in Bavaria and 
North Rhine-Westphalia during the reporting period. We also welcomed 
two new cooperation partners in 2017: the Frankfurt Zoological Society 
and Pro Wildlife e.V. At the end of the year we donated the proceeds 
from the devices collected through recycling and reuse to environmen-
tal organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe e.V.
In 2017 we joined together with radio station Antenne Unna to hold 
a cell phone collection competition between the communities of the 
region. The station followed the various collection campaigns and 
crowned one of the communities the victor. The objective of the compe-
tition was to increase listeners' awareness of environmentally friendly 
resource consumption. The proceeds from the sales and recycling activ-
ities were donated to the Lichtblicke e.V. charity.
In 2017 we collected exactly 148,888 used cell phones and smart-
phones throughout Germany and either reused them or had them prop-
erly recycled. During the cell phone collection campaign we use a data 
deletion process that is DEKRA certified and complies with strict data 
protection requirements. Defective cell phones or devices where certi-
fied data deletion would be too costly are properly recycled using state-
of-the-art, environmentally friendly processes at the Telekom Recycling 
Center in Goslar. Up to 100 percent of the materials can then be reused 
– as recycled metals or for energy generation.
We depict the relationship between commercially sold and collected 
mobile phones with our Cell Phone Collection ESG KPI.
We map the relationship between mobile devices brought onto the 
market and taken back with our ESG KPI "Take-back mobile devices". 
In 2017, approximately 317,000 mobile devices (excluding T-Mobile 
US, AMC, Maktel, Crnogorski) were taken back throughout the Group.
Support of various collection campaigns 
As in previous years, we supported the Die Handyaktion campaign 
conducted by different church-affiliated groups in the state of Baden-
Württemberg in 2017 as well. This time the partners reinforced the 
campaign, together with the German Mineral Resources Agency and 
the Ministry of the Environment of Baden-Württemberg, with various 
educational measures. For example, they redesigned the "cell phone 
raw materials kit" for school classes. The kit contains various minerals 
that are used in cell phones. Using accompanying teaching materials, 
teachers can explain the significance of the raw materials in smart-
phones to their students.
The Responsibility and Sustainability. Join in! collection campaign in 
the state of Saarland, which we have been supporting since 2014, was 
extended until the end of 2018 due to ongoing interest. We are still a 
cooperation partner to the campaign, which focuses on projects such 
as providing special course material on the topics of cell phone collec-
tion and resource efficiency. Mutual cell phone collection campaigns 
with Saarland companies and institutions are a further focus.

HANDSET RECYCLING AT T-MOBILE USA
T-Mobile USA’s device recycling program mobilizes customers to 
help reduce environmental and human health impacts from improper 
recycling. This program also increases access to quality reusable and 
refurbished equipment for those who need it, while conserving our 
limited natural resources.
Any wireless consumer can bring any make, model or carrier phone, 
battery, accessory, tablet or netbook into any T-Mobile USA location 
to be recycled for free. Through the JUMP! and Mobilize programs, 
T-Mobile USA incentivizes its customers to trade in their used devices 
and accessories for great deals on the latest technology. Those trade-
ins are all reused, refurbished or recycled.
In 2017, T-Mobile sponsored a special holiday recycling campaign 
to encourage customers to bring in their used devices to T-Mobile. 
T-Mobile matched the recycled value of each device, and donated USD 
1,000,000 from the campaign to Feeding America and Team Rubicon 
to support their hunger relief and disaster response initiatives.
T-Mobile USA launched the recycling program for its customers in 
2008, resulting in over 14.4 million devices being reused or resold since 
then. 87% of the devices that are taken back are reused or resold, with 
the rest being responsibly recycled by providers selected on the basis 
of their leading industry environmental certification.
In 2017, T-Mobile USA collected 4,130,582 used cell phones.
HANDSET RECYCLING PROJECT WITH PRIMARY SCHOOL 
PUPILS IN CROATIA
For many years, the international eco primary school in Sisak has been 
a beacon in its local community for collecting and dealing properly 
with old mobile phones. Hrvatski Telekom (HT) has a long tradition of 
proactive collaboration with Croatian schools and helps to teach pupils 
from an early age about adopting good habits for separate collection of 
waste, appropriate recovery and recycling. HT has been teaching pupils 
how to deal effectively with electronic waste, in particular the electronic 
waste from mobile phones and their accessories. This is an inspiring 
project within the company since it enables pupils to develop a respon-
sible attitude toward environmental protection and waste management.
In2017, HT continued its cooperation with the eco primary school in 
Sisak and celebrated the World Environment Protection Day by award-
ing all pupils who participated in the project for collecting old handsets. 
This year the pupils collected180obsolete mobile phones, which HT 
handed over to authorized companies for environment-friendly treat-
ment. Over a period of more than ten years, HT has used this project 
and other similar environmental projects and initiatives to collect a total 
of137,000old mobile phones and dispose of them in an eco-friendly 
way.
ACCESSIBLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Deutsche Telekom wants to make it easier for people with disabilities to 
have access to the knowledge and information society. Not only do we 
offer subsidized rates to people from low-income households, we also 
offer them to people with hearing and vision impairments. We also sup-
port them with products and solutions especially designed to meet their 
needs.
Services for the hearing impaired
We set up a hotline (Deaf Hotline) for deaf and hearing-impaired cus-
tomers in 2003. Up to 50 people currently call the hotline every day to 
get help with connections to their DSL routers or to find out more about 
special cell-phone rate plans, for example. The employees of the Deaf 
Hotline are equipped with live consultant workplaces that have HD cam-
eras, among other things. Customers and live consultants can see each 
other using a video-based live chat and can communicate with each 
other in sign language. Since 2017 the Deaf Hotline has also explicitly 
offered the option of making appointments with technicians.
For deaf customers and members of the German association for the 
deaf, Deutscher Gehörlosen-Bund e.V., we operate a special online dis-
tribution site (www.telekom.de/deaf). There we offer a discounted 
mobile communications and fixed-line portfolio that is tailored to the 
exact needs of deaf people. Customers can order their desired plans 
directly on the website, can contact the employees of the Deaf Hotline 
or be forwarded to the new information exchange platform DEAF-Café 
in the Telekom Hilft community. The DEAF-Café provides a safe space 
to discuss or clarify questions about telecom offers together with other 
deaf people in groups and forums.
Engagement for hearing impaired people in Slovakia
About 1% of the population in Slovakia is hearing impaired, and Slovak 
Telekom is very active in developing comprehensive programs and 
activities to support them in ordinary everyday living situations. We also 
help families with hearing-impaired children to master their everyday 
lives. Another aim is to raise public awareness about the challenges 
they face.
Since 2015, Slovak Telekom has hosted a community portal where par-
ents with hearing-impaired children can communicate with each other 
and find out important information. This portal supports hearing parents 
with hearing-impaired children in showing them how to properly stimu-
late and develop their children. In 2017, a lot of new content was added 
to the portal which was visited by thousands of individual visitors. A 
community of hundreds of returning visitors has started to form.
As a carrier, we provide significant support for the hearing impaired and 
offer them an advantageous mobile data package. In 2017, Telekom 
began to offer a preferential “Mobile Internet L” plan with a discount of 
more than 95 percent. In order to be eligible for the Mobile Internet L 
program for the deaf, the customer needs to be recognized as hearing 
impaired by the relevant Labor, Social Affairs and Family Office.
Since 2013, Telekom has also been offering a special mobile plan for 
hearing-impaired people thatincludes unlimited SMS and 2GB of inter-
net data on the mobile phone, along with 20 free minutes to all net-
works at a price of € 12 per month.

SUPPORTING START-UPS: CREATING SPACE FOR IDEAS
hub:raum start-up incubator 
We have been running our own start-up incubator in Berlin, Cracow 
and Tel Aviv since 2012 under the name hub:raum. This gives us direct 
insight into the innovative ideas of start-ups. In return, we offer access to 
our technological expertise and our customers. We also provide sup-
port with company development. Experienced entrepreneurs and 
Deutsche Telekom experts act as mentors to the start-ups in a variety of 
programs. In addition, hub:raum also provides selected start-ups seed 
funding of up to 300,000 euros.We made six investments in start-up 
companies in the reporting period. Interested start-ups can go to the 
hub:raum website and apply for collaboration or seed funding. Since 
April, hub:raum has been collaborating intensively with Partnering and 
Business Development at Deutsche Telekom, which is responsible for 
business collaborations. We also promote lots of new ideas for more 
sustainability with hub:raum.
hub.raum program for lightning-fast data transmission with 5G
The up-and-coming 5G mobile communications standard promises to 
provide more than just faster Internet speeds. This technology is creat-
ing entirely new possibilities for many sectors. So-called low latency 
interactions are a significant advantage. They enable very fast data 
transmission times. This could facilitate the tasks of first responders at 
accident sites, for example, by allowing them to exchange real-time data 
with doctors in hospitals. In 2017 hub:raum started a prototype program 
to promote the development of such innovative 5G-capable use cases 
in Europe. Companies have been able to sign up as partners for this 
project since October 2017. hub:raum has also been supporting good 
ideas for the use of the new mobile communications standard with test 
environments in Cracow and Berlin.
App in the gap: The eParkomat
In 2017 hub:raum invested in the eParkomat start-up company, which 
operates an app for digital parking space searches. Using an algorithm, 
the app calculates the number of available street parking spaces in real 
time. The app shows the empty parking spaces on a map and navigates 
the user directly to the respective space. The app also has benefits for 
the environment, since finding a parking space faster reduces the 
amount of CO2 emissions in cities. In 2017 eParkomat successfully 
completed a pilot project in Prague with more than 25,000 public park-
ing spaces. Thanks to hub:raum's investment, the company is slated to 
expand to other cities in 2018.
Mobile cell phone repair with Reparando
You need fast help if your cell phone or smartphone breaks down. Start-
up company Reparando does the necessary repairs directly at their cus-
tomers' home or office. Founded in mid-2015, the Stuttgart-based start-
up already has 10,000 repair jobs under its belt and offers its services 
in 20 German cities. hub:raum has supported the company since 2017. 
Repair services such as those offered by Reparando extend the life 
cycle of smartphones, thereby helping save resources.
Start-up support for internal "founders" 
Since 2011 we have been helping our employees develop their own 
concepts for new services and business areas at Deutsche Telekom 
within the context of the „UQBATE“ internal innovation program. 
Employees can present their ideas to interested colleagues on the 
UQBATE platform, create teams and then work together to gradually 
turn their ideas into products that are ready to go to market. 2017 was 
another year for exciting ideas. One of these ideas was BeOn Track, a 
particularly durable device for localizing people. BeOn Track does not 
use the GPS signal to locate people, but rather a new technology with 
a much longer battery life. This device could be used to quickly track 
down missing dementia patients, for example. The tracking device can 
be installed in a necklace or armband and works for up to 10 years.
TAKE-OFFS PROGRAM SUPPORTS REGIONAL START-UPS 
IN CZECH REPUBLIC
2017 saw the seventh round of the Take-offs program. The T-Mobile 
Czech Republic program provides financial support, long-term profes-
sional advice, and expertise to regional start-ups. The overall aim is to 
help potential entrepreneurs, who often come from vulnerable back-
grounds (people in regions of high unemployment, women on maternity 
leave, senior or handicapped citizens, students without work experi-
ence).
Out of the 437registered projects this year, 40regional winners were 
chosen and announced by an expert jury at9 regional workshops run 
for all interested participants free of charge and attended by 550 peo-
ple. The regional winners all receive a helping hand from experts in 
marketing, communication, and finance, as well as tangible, financial 
support worth EUR 3,700.
Members of the general public are invited to select the overall winner 
from among 40 regional winners. More than 14,000 people took part 
in the online voting and selectedPetr Šmídand his project called Hobl-
home (kitchen products made of wood) as the overall public winner to 
receive an award worth EUR 5,500. A professional jury also selected a 
national winner. This yearDagmar Duškováand her project called Damilk 
(production of homemade cheese) was selected as the national winner 
and received prizes worth a total of EUR 25,900.
The Take-offs again enjoyed significant media coverage. The winners 
were invited to present their projects on TV and radio, and in various 
print and online media.

In October 2015, the European Court of Justice determined that the 
Safe Harbor Agreement was invalid. In accordance with the agreement, 
U.S. companies were able to self-certify that they met European data pri-
vacy regulations. But these principles were not effectively implemented 
at those companies. Edward Snowden's revelations also demonstrated 
that U.S. security authorities store all of the personal data transmitted to 
the United States. The protection of personal data is part of the shared 
fundamental values in Europe. It is up to the German government, the 
EU Commission and the United States to create an appropriate basis 
for secure data exchange between Europe and the United States.
For us at Deutsche Telekom, the decision passed by the Court of Justice 
of the European Union is a sign that we are on the right path. We called 
for an "Internet of short distances" at an early stage, ensuring a direct 
path from the sender to the recipient when transferring data - without 
any detours through other jurisdictions such as the United States. This 
has already been implemented in our networks.
European business customers are critical of data storage outside of 
Europe; demand for secure cloud services "made in Europe" is growing. 
Our security solutions meet this demand. We guarantee the same high 
security standards at all of our data centers. We also develop products 
for consumers, such as products offering end-to-end encryption, and 
solutions for SMEs to detect and fend off hacker attacks in real time. 
In addition to data security, we have also introduced measures for 
consumer and youth protection.
To us, security is more than just protecting data and infrastructure - 
it also means protecting the public's health. We have established a 
Group-wide basis for this with our EMF policy.

We stand for the highest possible standards when it comes to consumer 
and youth protection. We want to teach children and young people in 
particular how to use digital media safely and effectively and protect 
them from inappropriate content, which is why we work throughout the 
Group to improve their media skills in a variety of projects. We also work 
with a variety of initiatives and partners to create a child-friendly Inter-
net. We have reinforced our stance with numerous national and interna-
tional voluntary commitments and internal codes of conduct. In doing 
so, we often exceed the standards required by national regulations.

PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND MINORS
Data privacy and data security are very important to us. In 2008 we 
created a Board of Management department for Data Privacy, Legal 
Affairs and Compliance as well as the Group Privacy unit. The responsi-
ble Board member has been advised by the independent Data Privacy 
Advisory Council, which comprises renowned experts from politics, 
science, business, and independent organizations, since 2009. In addi-
tion, we were the first DAX company to have our data privacy organiza-
tion reviewed and certified according to the IDW PS 980 standard in 
September 2014. At Deutsche Telekom, data protection and data secu-
rity are subject to the Group’s Binding Corporate Rules on Privacy and 
the Group Policy on General Security. The Binding Corporate Rules on 
Privacy govern the handling of personal data. The related document 
Binding Interpretations contains specific recommendations and best 
practice examples for implementing the EU General Data Protection 
Regulation, which will be enacted in May 2018. The Group Policy on 
General Security includes significant security-related principles fol-
lowed within the Group. Both guidelines set forth binding standards 
that are in line with international standard ISO 27001. These policies 
allow us to guarantee an adequately high and consistent level of secu-
rity and data privacy throughout the Group. Deutsche Telekom has been 
publishing an annual transparency report for Germany since 2014, 
which covers the types and amount of information we disclose to secu-
rity agencies. This way we comply with our legal obligations as a tele-
communications company. Our international business units have also 
been publishing similar transparency reports since 2016. We also pro-
vide up-to-date and transparent information about all of our activities 
and measures regarding data protection and data security on our Group 
website.
Our products and services have always provided a high degree of data 
privacy and data security. Growing volumes of data require special pre-
cautions to protect the privacy of citizens, which is why we approved 
eight mandatory principles for handling big data, or large amounts of 
personal data, in 2013. In January 2015, we also approved specific 
measures to protect data and infrastructure in our "Ten-point program 
for increased cyber security." We also developed new protective prod-
ucts including our Mobile Encryption app designed to ensure end-to-
end encryption of mobile communication.
Data privacy and security also play a key role in the development of 
our other products and services. Our Privacy and Security Assessment 
(PSA) procedure allows us to review the security of our systems in each 
step of the development process. This procedure applies to newly 
developed systems as well as existing systems that undergo changes  
in technology or in the way data is processed. We use a standardized 
procedure to document the data privacy and data security status of our 
products throughout their entire life cycle. Youth protection aspects are 
also taken into consideration in our product and service design. In  
Germany we involve our youth protection officer in all issues regarding 
planning and designing offers for young people. The youth protection 
officer can then recommend restrictions or changes. We have 
appointed a Child Safety Officer (CSO) at each of our national compa-
nies within the EU who is responsible for issues pertaining to the protec-
tion of minors. The CSO acts as a central contact for members of the 
community in the respective market. The CSO also plays a key internal 
role in coordinating topics related to the protection of minors. These 
measures increase the consistency and transparency of Deutsche  
Telekom's involvement in protecting minors.
Strategic approach to protecting minors from unsuitable media 
content
Our strategy to protect children and young people from harm when 
using digital media is based on three pillars. We
 
provide attractive, age-appropriate offers for children and give  
parents and guardians tools (filters) that they can use to restrict the 
access minors have to harmful content,
 
participate in combating child abuse and its depiction to the extent 
that this is permitted within the national legal framework,
 
and we promote skills to help people use the Internet safely.
We also collaborate closely with prosecuting authorities and NGOs as 
well as other partners from business, politics, and society to ban online 
content that is harmful to children and young people. We have docu-
mented our commitment to protecting minors from unsuitable media

content in Germany in relevant codes and introduced minimum stand-
ards. In 2007, we committed ourselves to fighting child pornography on 
the Internet throughout the European Union. At a global level, we have 
been a member of the global association of mobile providers, GSMA, 
since 2008, which pursues the same objectives. In order to better coor-
dinate our activities within the Group, we also approved a list of general 
guidelines in October 2013 for our activities to help protect minors from 
unsuitable media content and made these guidelines mandatory at 
international level, thereby setting new standards in our markets. In 
consideration of their particular cultural situation and business model, 
each national company in the European Union can further specify these 
measures, adopt additional measures, and also determine their own 
strategic focal points.
Because protecting minors from unsuitable media content poses a 
challenge that affects many industries, we cooperate with different 
organizations for the protection of minors and participate in coalitions 
that coordinate the involvement of companies and organizations from 
the Internet and media sector. For example, we are a member of the 
“CEO alliance to better protect minors online”, whose goal is to make 
the Internet a safer place for kids. We also play a leading role in the ICT 
Coalition for the Safer Use of Connected Devices and Online Services 
by Children and Young People in the EU. In this coalition, we pursue a 
comprehensive cross-industry approach based on six principles that 
expressly includes helping young people learn media skills.
In January 2013, as part of both coalitions, we announced plans to 
implement an EU-wide set of measures based on the principles of the 
ICT Coalition. The ICT Coalition published an annual report in April 
2014 on the implementation of corresponding measures at all of the 
companies represented in the ICT coalition. The report, which was 
written by an independent expert from the Dublin Institute of Technol-
ogy, comes to the conclusion that Deutsche Telekom's approach to 
implementing the ICT Coalition's principles is exemplary.
New strategic Cyber Defense and Security Operation Center
In October 2017, the Telekom Security unit expanded the Cyber 
Defense Center in Bonn into an integrated Cyber Defense and Security 
Operation Center (SOC). This new defense center is one of the largest 
and most modern ones of its kind in Europe, analyzing one billion 
pieces of security-relevant data from 3,000 data sources every day in
a nearly fully automated process.
PROTECTING PERSONAL DATA
Almost one-third of all Germans are afraid of their data being misused 
and of insufficient data security in general. These were the findings of 
the 2016 Security Report that we commissioned from the Allensbach 
Institute. However, we are by far the most trusted company in the ICT 
industry when it comes to handling personal data. And we are proud of 
it, because protecting our customers' data is one of our top priorities.
We also provide up-to-date information about all of our data protection 
activities on our Group website at https://www.telekom.com/en/corpo-
rate-responsibility/data-protection-data-security. The following are just 
a few examples of our activities during the reporting period.
Competition on digital data protection tools
At the beginning of 2017, we launched a worldwide idea competition. 
The competition called on participants to create a privacy bot - an intelli-
gent, digital data protection tool. The bot had to be useful for all sorts of 
web services, not just aimed at individual providers such as Facebook 
or travel portals. The award ceremony took place in July in Berlin. A 
team from Germany was the winner. This team developed a privacy bot 
that automatically verifies the Privacy Notices of Internet services based 
on individual preferences specified by the user. The privacy bot also 
provides a variety of other information relating to data privacy, such the 
number of data privacy incidents affecting the relevant Internet provider 
in the past.
There were 12 entries, five of which advanced to the final round, with 
the top three being awarded prize money. The jury was made up of data 
privacy experts as well as specialists from the Internet economy and the 
world of corporate communications. Among its most prominent mem-
bers was Peter Schaar, former German Federal Commissioner for Data 
Protection and Freedom of Information.
Mobile protection
According to the 2016 Security Report, about half of smartphone own-
ers in Germany have no software installed on their phone to protect it 
from cyber attacks. Since November 2017, we have partnered with the 
company Check Point Software Technologies to offer the Protect 
Mobile security solution for smartphones to our consumer customers. 
Protect Mobile detects and wards off cyber attacks in the mobile com-
munications network, before they can even get to the smartphone. This 
protection is automatically integrated into Deutsche Telekom's mobile 
communications network. The Protect Mobile app detects additional 
cyber attacks when browsing the Internet on a WLAN or using hotspots 
as well as when downloading apps, doing online banking or surfing in 
the browser. Deutsche Telekom customers can add this option on to 
their existing mobile phone contract. For the most complete protection, 
the free app is available for Android and IOS from app stores.
Simple data privacy statements for everyone
Data Privacy Notices are often incomprehensible to the layperson. Our 
one-pager provides our customers with an easy-to-read overview of data 
privacy at our company. It contains simple, condensed information on 
the basics behind our data processing activities. It does not replace our 
formal data privacy statement, to which we link in the document and 
which complies with legal requirements. Instead, it provides users with 
transparent information on how and to what extent we process and use 
personal data. With this one-pager, we have followed an initiative 
launched by the National IT Summit, supported by the Federal Ministry 
of Justice and Consumer Protection.
Encryption for all
Together with the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technol-
ogy (Fraunhofer SIT), we launched the "Volksverschlüsselung" encryp-
tion solution in mid-June 2016. It is a simple, free way to encrypt emails. 
We operate the solution at a high-security data center. The keys are gen-
erated on the user's device. The user is the only person with access to 
them; they are not sent to the infrastructure operator. To use the encryp-
tion, users only need to install the software and identify themselves as 
part of a simple one-time process. This product supports the federal 
government's digital agenda. What's more, we fulfill the requirements of 
the Charter for the Promotion of Trustworthy Communications (Charta 
zur Stärkung der vertrauenswürdigen Kommunikation), which was pro-
posed and signed by representatives from the business and scientific 
communities as well as by political representatives. For more informa-
tion, go to www.krypto-charta.de/.

COLLABORATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF MINORS
We want to create a safe, positive online experience for children and 
young people. We offer them attractive, exciting content on age-appro-
priate websites.
Promotion of standardized child protection offers
In August 2016, we joined the non-profit organization JusProge.V.. 
The organization operates the child protection program JusProg. The 
software, which can be installed on any computer, allows parents to 
decide which content their children can see. The system works with fil-
ter lists, among other things, which block many websites with unsuitable 
content and content that may even impair the development of minors. 
The system also allows you to enter customized settings based on age 
for the display of age-appropriate content.
This software is the only general child protection program in Germany 
that has been officially recognized by Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle Multi-
media-Diensteanbieter e.V. (FSM, association for the voluntary self-mon-
itoring of multimedia service providers) pursuant to statutory require-
ments (Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Human Dignity and the 
Protection of Minors in Broadcasting and in Telemedia). The software 
was most recently evaluated in March 2017.
We decided in 2016 to donate the rights to the program code behind 
our child protection software (Windows) and our child protection app, 
Surfgarten, (iPhone/iPad) to JusProg e.V. in order to expand our involve-
ment in child protection efforts.
Teachtoday in the Aktionsbund Digitale Sicherheit (Digital Security 
Action Alliance)
In addition to these solutions, we also promote secure and responsible 
media use among children and young people with our Teachtoday initi-
ative. The initiative supports children and their families with practical 
and everyday tips and materials.
FIGHTING CHILD PORNOGRAPHY
We consider it our obligation to take rigorous action against depictions 
of child abuse on the Internet. We have been involved in an EU-wide 
fight against the depiction of child abuse since 2007 in the European 
Framework for Safer Mobile Use by Younger Teenagers and Children. 
Since 2008 we have been committed to combating the spread of such 
content together with other mobile providers in a global association.
Since 2013 we have been actively participating in two cross-industry 
coalitions committed to fighting child abuse on the Internet, the "CEO 
Coalition to make the Internet a better place for kids" and the "ICT Coali-
tion for the Safer Use of Connected Devices and Online Services by 
Children and Young People in the EU."
New structures for cooperation on child safety on the Internet
We were involved in the work of the Centre for Child Protection on the
 Internet (I-KiZ) until the end of 2016. The I-KiZ was dissolved at the end 
of 2016. However, the important fields of activity of the forum were 
assumed by existing networks. The safer-internet.de association, for 
example, took over the jugend.support advice and help system. The No 
Gray Areas project is now being coordinated by jugendschutz-net – with 
the assistance of Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle Multimedia-Diensteanbieter 
e.V. (FSM, association for the voluntary self-monitoring of multimedia 
service providers). We are actively supporting this initiative as well.
DIGITAL INCLUSION OF SENIOR CITIZENS AND SCHOOL 
CHILDREN IN CZECH REPUBLIC
As part of our e-safety strategy, T-Mobile Czech Republic issued a bro-
chure called “Safely on the Net” that will be distributed to our customers 
for free in the shops. The illustrated and lifestyle-like publication was 
written in cooperation with a specialist on e-safety. It is intended for all 
users of the internet but with the main focus on parents. It includes tips 
on avoiding risks when using computers, the internet, and social net-
works in particular.
The main part is dedicated to tips on how to protect children from 
potential abuse and the Školák (“Schoolchild”) package is a special 
offer for parents of schoolchildren. Independently of the child’s mobile 
credit, parents can purchase the package to keep an eye on their chil-
dren’s movements, protect them against inappropriate content on the 
internet and keep track of their mobile credit. The package is linked to 
the “Surfie” application. This app is provided free of charge and makes 
it possible to track the location of children and restrict viewing of inter-
net content.
The app is in the Czech language, works with iOS and Android operat-
ing systems, and includes three licenses. These can be used to protect 
three children or they can be installed on three different devices. The 
app requires internet access and the bundle therefore contains a 10 MB 
data allowance per month for the child. After the data allowance has 
been used up, the internet access speed slows down. However, children 
will still be able to use the app.
In the area of IT and e-safety, we held 4 seminarsfor senior citizens on 
“How to use mobile phones” and “Internet and apps” at the Centre for 
seniors in Prague. The seminars were run for 25 participantsbyT-Mobile 
employees.

If a customer is affected, Deutsche Telekom experts will help them 
delete insults, disreputable slander or other defamatory content on the 
Internet. This involves researching the appropriate contacts, initiating 
exchanges between the conflicting parties and compiling replies. Our 
services are tailored to meet the needs of each case. In addition to a 
digital service, a service phone number (0800-330 1473) has also been 
set up where Deutsche Telekom experts provide assistance.
Since the introduction of Computerhilfe Plus, the need for security and 
support for digital topics has risen steadily. That's why the Digital 
Schutzpaket (Digital Protection Package) will replace Computerhilfe 
Plus in the spring of 2018. This package offers comprehensive preven-
tive measures such as home network security and data backup. It also 
provides assistance in case of damage, such as financial losses due to 
online purchases, data retrieval or cyber bullying.

Criminal hackers are getting more and more professional by the day. 
Private individuals as well as public organizations, companies and the 
military are all at risk. Weaknesses in computer systems are often taken 
advantage of within hours, with attacks being run fully automatically.
As a responsible ICT provider, we are fighting this trend. Our business 
model includes guaranteeing our customers a high degree of security 
and effectively protecting the data and infrastructure of the 
people and companies who use our services from unauthorized access.

PROTECTING OURSELVES AND OUR CUSTOMERS
Based on our Group strategy, we promote our business with security 
products and services throughout Europe. In 2016 we united all secu-
rity-related departments Group-wide under one roof, thereby expanding 
our abilities to not only detect cyber attacks early on but also to quickly 
introduce countermeasures. Our new Telekom Security unit started up 
operations at the beginning of 2017. It focuses on internal security 
issues and develops security solutions for consumers as well as busi-
ness customers. With this approach we can provide our customers with 
the perfect security solutions along the entire value-added chain, from 
product development to secure, high-performance networks and high-
security data centers to applications and individual consulting.
We are always working to develop new ways to defend against attacks. 
To this end, we established our own Cyber Defense Center in Bonn in 
2014. There we analyze behavioral patterns on the Internet and draw up 
defense strategies. In October 2017 we expanded the Center, which is 
now an integrated Cyber Defense and Security Operation Center (SOC). 
This new defense center is one of the largest and most modern ones of 
its kind in Europe, analyzing one billion pieces of security-relevant data 
from 3,000 data sources every day. What's more, the cyber defense 
center processes about 1,000 requests, filters about 1,000 viruses and 
malware programs and scans about 10 million incoming e-mails for 
spam every day. This is how we protect our infrastructure, and hence 
also our customers' data. Some 200 security experts work round the 
clock at the new SOC in Bonn and its affiliated national and interna-
tional locations.
The measures that we undertake to fight cyber attacks on our own infra-
structure are also available to other companies. More than 30 German 
DAX companies and SMEs are already employing our services for their 
own protection.
New dangers require new solutions 
Technological innovations can bring new dangers. That is why we 
develop targeted measures for combating potential new security risks – 
such as those associated with drones, for example. We developed the 
Magenta Drone Shield together with our partner Dedrone. At Drone 
Detection Day 2017, we presented the drone defense shield to the pub-
lic together with DFS, the German air traffic control service.
Collaborating in the name of security 
Cyber security is a communal task. In order to further improve collabora-
tion in the area of digital defense, we regularly host the Cyber Security 
Summit, in collaboration with the Munich Security Conference. The last 
summit was held in June 2017. We also organized the Magenta Security 
Congress in 2017 for the second time.
We also collaborate with research institutes, industry partners, initia-
tives, standardization committees, public institutions and other Internet 
service providers on a global scale. Together, we want to fight cyber-
crime and improve online security. We collaborate, for example, with the 
German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) throughout Ger-
many and with the European Union Agency for Network and Information 
Security (ENISA) at a European level.
We also provide up-to-date information about our numerous data pro-
tection activities at www.telekom.com/en/corporate-responsibility/data-
protection-data-security.
CYBER SECURITY SUMMIT
Together with the Munich Security Conference, we organized the Cyber 
Security Summit (CSS) in June 2017, which marked the fifth time we did 
so. The venue was Tel Aviv. Israel is among the leading countries in the 
area of cyber security.
About 150 high-ranking international politicians, top managers and sci-
entists met at the conference to discuss the biggest cyber security chal-
lenges and offer ideas for solutions. Also up for debate were the topics 
of refining international cyber strategies and how to protect critical infra-
structures in the brave new connected world.
MAGENTA SECURITY CONGRESS
How do I adequately protect myself and my company from cyber 
attacks? What are the latest security trends and solutions? How high is 
the risk of elections being hacked in Germany? Questions such as these 
were the focus of the Magenta Security Congress, which took place on 
June 20-21, 2017 in Munich. There Deutsche Telekom teamed up with 
experts in the security sector for the second time to share current cyber 
security developments with national and international partners as well 
as customers.

IT DRONE DEFENSE SHIELD
Drones can make many processes easier and more efficient – for exam-
ple, in the film and surveying technology or logistics sectors. But the 
technical opportunities drones provide can also be misused for illegal 
and criminal objectives. Since the end of 2016, the Magenta Drone 
Shield has offered our customers an IT solution that protects them from 
the increasing danger of private drones. Business customers with criti-
cal infrastructures, data centers, stadiums, and authorities can secure 
their premises from remote controlled flying objects with the shield and 
thus defend themselves against espionage, smuggling and vandalism.
In order to develop the Magenta Drone Shield, we first intensively tested 
the worldwide leading systems for detecting and defending against 
drones. We then bundled the best technologies into an integrated offer 
together with our partner Dedrone. The Dedrone DroneTracker, which, 
as a special Telekom version, is part of the Magenta Drone Shield, 
detects drones with the help of various sensors such as video cameras, 
frequency scanners and microphones. We also help our customers fight 
the danger of drones with organizational measures and, if necessary, 
by implementing electronic countermeasures. The use of jamming must 
be approved by the necessary authorities.
Drone Detection Day 2017
At Drone Detection Day in June 2017 in the Hessian city of Langen, we 
pointed out the challenges of the ever-growing use of drones together 
with DFS, the German air traffic control service. The Magenta Drone 
Shield was also presented to the public. The shield reliably detected 
various types of drones, which simulated various danger scenarios, 
and issued warnings about them.

Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are a prevalent element in our connected 
world, even if we are not able to perceive them directly. Their effects on 
our health remain a topic of discussion. It is very important to make sure 
that the EMFs employed do not present a problem for people or the 
environment when we use them in mobile communications.
The effects of electromagnetic fields have been thoroughly researched 
over past decades in numerous scientific studies. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) analyzes the findings of scientific research and 
recently made a statement regarding the results in October 2014. In its 
statement the World Health Organization concludes that the 
current threshold values for electromagnetic fields ensure that mobile 
communications technology can be used safely but that further 
research is required.
Deutsche Telekom has made a commitment to actively address scien-
tific research on mobile communications and health, and provides 
detailed information on the Group website regarding the latest technol-
ogy and scientific risk assessments published by expert committees 
and organizations. To this end, we published a brochure titled "Fakten 
zu Mobilfunk und Gesundheit" ("Facts about mobile communications 
and health") and revised it in 2017. The document is available on our 
Group website: https://www.telekom.com/de/verantwortung/klima-und-

 § Evaluating the EMF Policy
STRIVING FOR SECURE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS
We want to make our mobile communications infrastructure and our 
new products, as well as the processes on which they are based, as 
resource-efficient, secure and safe for health as possible. In Germany 
these activities are based in particular on voluntary commitments by 
mobile communications providers and an agreement with local authori-
ties' associations. Compliance with these voluntary commitments is 
reviewed every two years by external experts. We submitted our annual 
mobile communications expert report to the German Federal Govern-
ment in 2016. What's more, in collaboration with Telefónica, we also 
support the information portal www.informationszentrum-mobilfunk.de.
Our Group-wide EMF Policy, which we adopted in 2004, plays a pivotal 
role. The policy specifies standardized minimum requirements in the 
area of mobile communications and health, requirements that by far 
exceed those set forth by national laws. Our policy provides our national 
companies with a mandatory framework that makes sure that the topic 
of mobile communications and health is addressed in a consistent, 
responsible way throughout the Group. All of our national companies 
have officially accepted the EMF Policy and implemented most of the 
required measures.
Our EMF Policy stipulates the following principles and measures:
Transparency
We place importance on discussing issues involved in mobile communi-
cations openly. We make all relevant information regarding our mobile 
communications equipment in Germany accessible to the public, e.g., 
on the EMF database operated by the German Federal Network Agency.
Information
We provide consumer information that is easy to understand and pur-
sue a fact-based, sound information policy. On our Group website we 
provide the latest information to those interested. We also provide our 
customers with information on the SAR levels of their devices. In addi-
tion, customers can get information on SAR levels at many of our shops, 
via our free environmental hotline or via e-mail.
Participation
We rely on close collaboration and constructive dialog with all those 
involved, including communities, when it comes to network expansion. 
Our goal is to find amicable solutions and negotiate acceptable com-
promises, which can only be achieved by responding fairly to critical 
arguments and being ready to learn from mistakes.
Promoting science & partnerships
Our guidelines call for promoting targeted research, scientific excel-
lence, transparency, objectivity and intelligibility.
We conduct ongoing reviews of compliance with our EMF Policy. The 
findings are used to improve individual aspects and develop solutions 
in different working groups such as our EMF Core Team and the EMF 
Technical Working Group.
EVALUATING AND IMPLEMENTING THE EMF POLICY 
We want to seamlessly implement our EMF Policy throughout the 
Group. We help our national companies do this by providing specific 
tools. For example, we formulated standardized policies for funding 
research, for example, and published these on the Deutsche Telekom

website. The national companies take these policies into account when 
formulating their own funding programs. We also rely on our national 
companies' own initiative and encourage them to continue to improve 
their measures even after they have fully implemented the EMF Policy. 
The dialog conducted by the Deutsche Telekom national companies 
with other network providers and with consumers, politicians and scien-
tists plays a central role in this context.
Regular reviews show us that the EMF Policy is being implemented in all 
of our action areas. We are also working on expanding our country-spe-
cific activities.
In 2016 we introduced small cells, an innovative, high-performance 
mobile communications technology. Small cells add additional capacity 
to our mobile communications network in places with high traffic vol-
umes. Small cells generally emit weaker electromagnetic fields than
 traditional macrocells as they are used in mobile communications net-
works. Due to the small distance, the cell phone's transmission power 
can be reduced with small cells. Because cell phone transmission levels 
are often the main source of electromagnetic fields in our immediate 
environment, reducing these is a particularly effective way to reduce 
EMF exposure. In 2017 we commissioned a study from RWTH Aachen 
in cooperation with TU Ilmenau. The study aimed to elaborate practical 
procedures for assessing the effect of small cells on people and the 
environment. The results were discussed in October 2017 in a work-
shop with representatives of various scientific institutes and the compe-
tent authorities.
The state capital of Munich has partnered with Deutsche Telekom since 
2016 to conduct a pilot project adopted by the Munich City Council for 
the development of innovative small cells. During the project, small cells 
sites were measured, and the results were presented to the City of 
Munich in July 2017.
In Austria, the citizens' mobile communications forum gives interested 
citizens the opportunity to ask experts questions about mobile commu-
nications directly and online. The forum is an initiative sponsored by the 
industry association Forum Mobilkommunikation (FMK). Over time, it 
has grown into a knowledge platform containing answers to the most 
important questions regarding the topics of mobile communications 
technology and mobile communications and health.

SOCIETY
We want to be a trustworthy partner for people in an increasingly digital 
world and want to enable equal participation in the information and 
knowledge society to as many people as possible. That is why we are 
laying the foundation for everyone being able to navigate the digital 
world safely and competently. We are involved in social concerns with 
our own initiatives and programs and support charitable organizations.

The digital revolution is changing our lives. The technological opportu-
nities that come along with it are almost infinite. Digitalization has the 
potential to make the world a better place to live in – by providing easy 
access to information, enabling greater transparency and providing a 
previously unheard-of capacity to create networks. But it also bears risk. 
This raises many general ethical issues: How much technology is (still) 
good for human beings? What defines humans and differentiates us 
from machines and robots?
To stand still or go back are no options because the digital development 
cannot be stopped or even reversed. Rather, digitalization must be 
designed for the purposes of human beings - a task that challenges 
everyone: politics, economy and civil society. In addition, humans must 
be enabled to use opportunities and to avoid dangers. In this context we 
as a telecommunications company consider ourselves to carry respon-
sibility. Grouped together under the question "Are we stumbling blindly 
into digitalization? We need digital responsibility!“ we started an initia-
tive in 2016, with which we are facing our Corporate Digital Responsibil-
ity. The main idea behind this is that we have to deal with the question 
of exactly what shape digital responsibility is going to take.  But no one 
company, institution or government can mandate digital responsibility 
on its own. It is something that involves everyone. For this reason, we 
are seeking dialog with experts, opinion leaders, but also regular citi-
zens. In our web special, we are offering information and expert inter-
views and during our events, we invite discussion. Furthermore, we are 
also engaged in numerous other initiatives and through other activities.
In order to ensure everyone can participate in the knowledge and infor-
mation society, it is important that they know how to use digital media 
safely, competently, and responsibly. Media literacy has become a key 
skill. Our aim is to make sure that people know how to competently and 
safely use new technologies regardless of their social background or 
personal abilities. With our numerous projects and initiatives in Ger-
many and Europe, we target children and young people as well as 
adults and people of a more advanced age.
It remains part of our social responsibility to support people seeking 
refuge in Germany with cultural integration and inclusion in the employ-
ment market. Our goal is to open up career perspectives for a success-
ful new start and motivate other employers to join in. We are convinced 
that companies as well as politics and civil society make an important 
contribution to the integration of refugees into our society.
We also apply our civil duty regionally, in particular in Bonn, where our 
headquarters is located. There, we support the local sport with Telekom 
Baskets and Baskets@school, and cultural events such as the Beethov-
enfest Bonn and the Jazzfest Bonn. On our numerous Social Days, we 
give our employees throughout Germany the opportunity to volunteer 
for local social projects or the environment.

WHAT MAKES US A RELIABLE PARTNER IN THE DIGITAL WORLD
Digital technologies have penetrated German society like never before. 
This is shown in the D21 Digital Index 2017, which is promoted by 
Deutsche Telekom. However, the index also shows that with respect to 
the use of digital technologies, there are big differences between indi-
vidual groups in society. Having access to modern information technolo-
gies is the basis for the ability to participate in the knowledge and infor-
mation society. We are committed to ensuring that everyone, regardless 
of age, background or education, can participate in digital society. That 
is why we are continuing to rapidly expand our infrastructure and 
improve transmission speeds with new, secure technology. At the same 
time, we use our social initiatives to reduce potential obstacles to ICT 
use. To this end, we contribute our core expertise as an international 
ICT corporation. We develop our own offers and support partner initia-
tives with our expertise in this area. We have specific goals in this 
aspect, for ourselves as well as for our partners.
Our activities focus on the following:
Creating awareness
The only way to effectively shape the digitalization process is in collabo-
ration with the worlds of business, politics and society. We have made a 
commitment to promoting social dialog and are active in collaborations 
and partnerships to facilitate this dialog. By signing the Charter of Digi-
tal Networking we emphasize our commitment.
If the digitalization process is to succeed, it is vital that people have faith 
in the confidentiality of their personal data. Data privacy and data secu-
rity are our highest priority, which is why we support the conscious and 
safe handling of personal data, for example with our online guide 
sicherdigital.de.

The question of whether and how information and news on the Internet 
can be identified as "true” is also vital to ask. We have addressed this 
subject internally on our activity day "1001 truths - trust and opinion-
forming online".
Supporting implementation
With our expertise, we support projects and initiatives that offer digital 
solutions for social challenges:
 
We are a member of the association Deutschland sicher im  
Netz e. V. [DSiN] (Making Germany Safe on the Net), which serves 
as a central point of contact for IT security and data protection 
issues.
 
In the context of DsiN, we support the Digital Neighborhoodproject, 
which trains people to be volunteer IT ambassadors.
 
With the virtual reality game "Sea Hero Quest VR", we are making  
a contribution to dementia research.
 
In the context of our corporate volunteering activities, our employ-
ees are participating in helping refugees to learn the German lan-
guage online through the program eStart. Further, they spark chil-
dren's interest for STEM subjects as reading tutors and mark wheel-
chair friendly locations on an online map wheelmap.org.
We are also working to further improve access to modern information 
technology. Within the scope of the Telekom@School initiative, we 
therefore offer general and vocational schools throughout Germany free 
Internet access up to 16 Mbit. Connections at higher speeds are availa-
ble to schools at significantly reduced prices.
We also offer special rates to enable low-income customers and people 
with disabilities to make phone calls and surf the web at reasonable 
prices. More than one million customers in Germany take advantage of 
these special plans each year. 
Strengthening skills
 
"Teachtoday" is our initiative promoting safe, competent use of 
media. It supports children, young people and parents as well as 
teachers by offering hands-on tips and materials. 
 
The free children’s magazine „Scroller“ by the Teachtoday initiative 
encourages children to think about how they use media and learn to 
co-create the digital world. 
 
We strengthen competence in the STEM fields of science, technol-
ogy, engineering, mathematics with a number of measures and  
programs. Many of these projects are supported by the Deutsche  
Telekom Stiftung foundation.
 
Along with four other foundations, the Deutsche Telekom Founda-
tion is a supporter of the "Education and Digitalization Forum" that 
intends to improve equality with digital media education.http://www.
forumbd.de/ 
 
With its "Yes, I can!" initiative, Deutsche Telekom Stiftung supports 
projects and organizations that help socially and educationally dis-
advantaged young people improve their personal and media skills. 
 
We are also involved in the Digital-Kompassproject, which offers  
volunteers a platform to help seniors navigate the Internet. 
 
Along with the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisa-
tionen (BAGSO, German Association of Senior Citizens' Organiza-
tions), we support the media literacy of older people and also sup-
port the "Golden Internet Award" for competent internet users age 
60 and up. In this context, Deutsche Telekom awarded the special 
prize "Letting ideas grow" in 2017 to a special project that is now 
being supported in its implementation.

We want to be a reliable partner in the digitalized world. This is why we 
work to raise awareness of the opportunities and challenges that digital-
ization brings and encourage public dialog, for example, by fostering 
the Charter of Digital Networking. 
“1001 TRUTHS – TRUST AND OPINION FORMING ONLINE” 
ACTIVITY DAY 
The Internet makes it possible to distribute information directly and 
unfiltered. Serious news is more and more often mixed with opinions or 
"fake news". And in social networks, insults and hate messages can be 
found more and more often. But how can fake news be identified? And 
what can we do about personal attacks and insults on the Internet? 
More than 2000 of our employees discussed these and other questions 
in July 2017 during the "1001 Truths - trust and opinion forming online” 
activity day in Bonn.
Internal and external experts were on hand to answer questions, from 
Barack Obama's election campaign manager to the founder of "Hate 
helps", a Facebook group that turns hate messages into donations. In 
numerous presentations and personal talks, the experts provided infor-
mation about the impact of fake news and ways of identifying it. Further-
more, our employees were able to participate in discussion rounds with 
internal and external experts, found out how the police use their social 
media channels or how they can react to cyberbullying, and learned 
more about the darknet in our Cyber Defense Center.
SAFETY FIRST: OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURE HANDLING  
OF DATA
Deutsche Telekom continuously works on providing transparent infor-
mation on data protection for Internet users and raising the users’ 
awareness of the necessity to handle data securely. The sicherdigital.de 
advice portal, for example, provides information on online risks and  
protective measures. Our Teachtoday initiative and our engagement in 
"Making Germany safe on the net" are our commitment to more secure 
and competent media usage.

Raising awareness
RAISING AWARENESS
89
We want to enable people to participate in the knowledge and informa-
tion society and to benefit from the opportunities of digitalization. It is 
not just technical access to the Internet that is crucial for this, but also 
that people know how to use digital medial safely, competently and 
responsibly. For this reason, we teach specific target groups about 
opportunities and risks and are committed to improving their digital 
skills. All such initiatives in Germany, including Teachtoday, will be pre-
sented on our website www.medienabersicher.de. We relaunched the 
website in 2017 and are successively expanding it. Our activities in Ger-
many in the area of youth protection are presented on a page dedicated 
to the protection of young people, which was re-designed in 2017 and is 
part of our corporate website. This is how we are complying with the 
transparency requirements of our international voluntary commitments 
such as the ICT Coalition or the Alliance to Better Protect Minors Online, 
which aim to create better online environments for children and young 
people. Deutsche Telekom Stiftung's purpose is promoting digital skills 
and thus supports projects and programs in that area. 
TEACHTODAY – AN INITIATIVE FOR SAFE, COMPETENT  
MEDIA US
Teachtoday(www.teachtoday.de) supports children, young people,  
parents and grandparents as well as teachers by offering hands-on tips 
and material about safe and competent media usage.. Among other 
things, Teachtoday has developed a media obstacle course that is a fun 
way of learning about safe media use.
All information are available in German, English, Croatian, German, 
Montenegran, Polish, Romanian, and Hungarian. And on YouTube, 
Teachtoday can be enjoyed with its own channel, which provides short, 
catchy videos about safe, competent Internet use, data protection and 
the issue of being authentic on the Internet.
Student projects award at "Summit for Kids"  
At this year's event of Teachtoday "Summit for Kids" in November 2017, 
the six finalist teams of the competition "Medien, abersicher" (Media,  
of course) were in the focal point. They had previously qualified for the 
finale in a public online vote and then carried out a project under the 
heading "Do the media influence opinion?” The media scouts of the 
comprehensive school Heinrich-Heine-Gesamtschule in Duisburg 
landed first place with a project that addressed the structure, effects 
and dangers of chain letters. Media scouts are students who contribute 
to media competence among their fellow students. The children from 
Duisburg designed their own chain letter experiment in order to educate 
their fellow students on the subject.
Partner events: Touring the country to promote safe online behavior
With their own event day at the Haus der Geschichte in Bonn (German 
History Museum), Teachtoday 2017 participated again in the Safer 
Internet Day. This time, the event took place under the motto "Be the 
change: unite for a better internet". In various workshops, more than  
60 school kids learned how to use digital media safely and to form their 
own opinions and answers to problems. The workshops dealt with 
important aspects such as safety, data protection, duration of cell phone 
use or cyberbullying. All participants also went through the Teachtoday 
media obstacle course.
Safe online media usage was also the subject of the event day sup-
ported by Teachtoday for the pilot project FSJdigital of the German  
Red Cross. More than 200 children participated in this event in March  
of 2017 in Halle (Saale). The young schoolchildren had fun exploring 
safe media use at four stations of the Teachtoday media obstacle 
course. Among other things, the children learned how to create a strong 
password and how to protect their personal data. All stations were  
monitored by second year FSJdigital volunteers. In order to prepare the 
volunteers for the day, they were given special coaching by Teachtoday 
employees.Moreover, Teachtoday was present at the German Youth 
Conference "Media 2017" in Rostock, where over 210 media scouts 
from all over Germany got together. Teachtoday was at the event with 
three different product options to show the media scouts how they 
can support elementary school students in the safe, competent use 
of digital media.
Award-winning initiative  
The Teachtoday initiative received a number of awards in 2017 once 
again. As in the previous year, Teachtoday received three Comenius 
EduMedia Seals presented by the scientific association Gesellschaft für 
Pädagogik und Information (GPI). The entire initiative was recognized 
in the "Didactic Multimedia Products" category, the obstacle course in 
the "Competence-Building Computer Games" category, and the Scroller 
magazine in the "General Multimedia Products" category.
CONNECTED KIDS PROJECT IN AUSTRIA
Digital literacy is becoming a basic skill required for participating in 
any aspect of society. T-Mobile Austria wants to use its Connected Kids 
project to raise awareness among students, parents and teachers about 
the many different ways of making use of mobile Internet for learning. 
The company also wants to advance the use of digital media in schools. 
Since its launch in 2013, almost 10,000 students in some 400 partici-
pating classes and about 500 teachers have already had the chance 
to explore digital learning in a connected classroom. The topic of this 
year’s “Connected Kids” event was “The digital school is more than

0 and 1”. One of the key themes was the profound change that the digi-
tization of school books will bring in the future, as it offers individualized 
learning experiences. The overall aim of the annual event is to introduce 
teachers, parents and employees to new learning formats that corre-
spond with the current transformation of society towards digitalization, 
automatization, and interconnectedness.Educational and technical sup-
port is provided by T-Mobile Austria to make sure students get to experi-
ence all the advantages of mobile communication in teaching.
The Connected Kids blog is an important tool to make the experience 
of using digital media in schools and families part of a connected class-
room available to the general public.
Long-term project goals include inspiring students to pass on what they 
learn to people outside traditional educational institutions.
GETTING A HEAD START WITH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES: OUR 
CHILDREN'S MAGAZINE SCROLLER
The Teachtoday initiative’s media magazine Scroller was published 
twice in 2017. The magazine targets children between the ages of nine 
and twelve and provides parents and teachers with information in spe-
cial supplements. It encourages children to think about how they use 
media and learn to co-create the digital world. Scroller is available 
online and as a free print version which is read by14,000 subscribers. 
The scroller.de portal is available in German and English.
Deutsche Telekom has provided the initiative Teachtoday 2017 with 
free outdoor advertising space. There, Scroller was advertised in a 
national billboard campaign for three months at 4,300 locations with an 
attention-grabbing motif.
Scroller was also once again recommended by StiftungLesen 2017, the 
German Reading Foundation, to promote safe, competent media use. 
Furthermore, Scroller won the "German Design Award 2018" in the 
"Excellent Communications Design Editorial” category.
SHAPING EDUCATION – THE DEUTSCHE TELEKOM STIFTUNG 
FOUNDATION
The Deutsche Telekom Foundation is engaged in good education in  
the digital world and is focused on the subjects of science, technology, 
engineering and math (STEM). The foundation began combining its 
activities under the categories of "education drivers," "education oppor-
tunities," "education innovations" and "education dialog" in July 2016. 
Projects such as the "Junior Engineering Academy" are examples of the 
foundation’s successful work. Since January of 2017, the "Yes I can!"  
initiative has officially been integrated into Deutsche Telekom Stiftung, 
where it is one of the projects in the "Education Opportunities” action 
area.
Forum Bildung Digitalisierung
Deutsche Telekom Stiftung launched the „Forum Bildung Digital-
isierung“ education and digitalization forum together with four other 
German foundations in 2016. Since September of 2017, two additional 
foundations have joined forces with Deutsche Telekom Stiftung. All the 
foundations involved in the initiative are convinced that digital media 
can help improve the education system, thereby improving participation 
and equal opportunity. The three core topics of the initiative are "per-
sonalized learning," "developing skills," and "shaping change." When it 
comes to personalized learning, digital media can be used to give differ-
ent target groups access to different learning approaches, including 
people with disabilities, particularly talented people and refugees. The 
goal of the second core topic is to convey the media skills necessary for 
living an independent life. "Shaping change" focuses on developing an 
educational concept for using digital media at educational institutions 
and within the education system.
The Forum also looks to engage in dialog with different participants in 
the educational sector and to develop new approaches to education. 
Experts from the worlds of science and education collaborate at confer-
ences, in networks and at development workshops to find answers to 
the big questions and challenges involved in the digital transformation 
of educational institutions. The schulentwicklung.digital workshop 
focuses on changing the school and learning culture through the use 
of digital media. 38 schools that are already successfully using digital 
media in the classroom are participating in the workshop.

The STEM reading mentors 
In collaboration with the German Reading Foundation, Deutsche  
Telekom Stiftung is looking for volunteer reading mentors to get chil-
dren from the ages of 3 to 10 excited about STEM content. A total of 
1,450 reading mentors have already signed up to the network, including 
six mentors in Madrid and Málaga. The reading mentors receive training 
in both classroom and online formats. They are then able to work with 
children at day-care centers and elementary schools. At the end of 
2017, Deutsche Telekom Stiftung and the German Reading Foundation 
were able to offer around 100 media and action tips in nine languages. 
In 2017, there were STEM reading events in Germany, Austria, Roma-
nia, Spain and the USA.
GestaltBar – the digital workshop
Young people need to learn how to skillfully and creatively use digital 
tools so they can actively shape their lives and have the opportunity to 
work in a future-oriented profession. With its "GestaltBar – the digital 
workshop" project, Deutsche Telekom particularly targets students at 
lower-level secondary schools. The goal is to use a hands-on approach 
to introduce young people to digital technology and give them some 
insight into the different technical professions. Courses include topics 
like robotics, app development and 3D printing. The project is initially 
being conducted in four pilot locations – Bonn, Berlin, Hamburg and 
Cologne.
Calliope Mini – a mini-computer for young schoolchildren
The Calliope Mini mini-computer helps young schoolchildren learn 
how to program a computer. In 2017, Calliope gGmbH provided pilot 
schools in the states of Saarland and North Rhine-Westphalia with mini-
computers. The Deutsche Telekom Stiftung foundation supports the 
project by developing and testing learning materials and course con-
cepts. Ideas for the creative use of digital technology are currently being 
worked on at six universities within the scope of the "Elementary school 
digital learning" project.
Junior Engineer Academy
The Junior Engineer Academygets secondary-level students (grade 
eight and higher) excited about technical professions and careers in 
engineering. The Junior Engineer Academy is offered as an elective at 
participating schools for two years and conducted in collaboration with 
universities, scientific institutes and companies. The project was imple-
mented for the first time in 2005 and gives students the opportunity to 
put the knowledge they learn in the classroom into practice. Since the 
beginning of the project, the school network has been growing steadily. 
In 2017, nine new Junior Engineer Academies joined the network, 
which means that there are already 88 schools in Germany that offer 
an academy. In 2017, for example, students from secondary schools in 
Leipzig were able to research interesting telecommunications projects 
the Leipzig University of Applied Sciences (HfTL). One group of stu-
dents developed a cost-efficient robot that can be used in IT classes at 
school.
For the school year 2018/2019, Deutsche Telekom Stiftung is inviting 
applications for new junior engineering academies across Germany for 
the last time. Schools that would like to integrate the teaching model on 
a long-term basis into their teaching schedule can submit an application 
to Deutsche Telekom Stiftung along with their concepts. Deutsche 
Telekom Stiftung will provide the winning schools with seed funding of 
up to 10,000 euros to enable them to set up a Junior Engineer Academy. 
Participants are encouraged to meet regularly at annual JIA conferences 
to share their experiences.
FundaMINT
FundaMINT is Deutsche Telekom Stiftung's grant program for student 
teachers in STEM subjects. It helps student teachers get ready for their 
future career. Up to 25 grants are awarded every year for a period of 
four semesters each. The program was expanded in collaboration with 
the PädagogischerAustauschdienst (PAD), a department of the Stand-
ing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs, and 
the Central Agency for German Schools Abroad. Grant recipients now 
have the opportunity to work at schools in central, eastern and southern 
Europe, conduct student projects and participate in preparatory and 
post-project seminars.
STEM Didactics Fellowship program
 In 2017, Deutsche Telekom Stiftung invited applications for the STEM 
Didactics Fellowship program for the second time. Up to nine fellow-
ships are granted each year to young researchers and scientists in the 
fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, 
technology and science education. The young fellows can attend semi-
nars and workshops on topics such as job negotiations and supervising 
doctoral candidates and are involved in the Deutsche Telekom Stiftung 
network.
"Yes, I can!" initiative: support for 82 new digital competence 
projects 
With the "Yes, I can!" initiative, Deutsche Telekom Stiftung teaches 
young people key skills for an independent and confident life in the 
digital world. In 2017, 82 open youth work projects fostering digital 
skills were funded through the initiative. The overall funding amount 
was once again around 600,000 Euro in 2017.
The key aim of the initiative is to empower children and young people 
and facilitate their participation in social development through skills 
building. In 2017, the project focuses on the development of media and 
digital skills. The age bracket for the target group was slightly expanded 
and is now between 9 and 16 years. More than 1,200 projects through-
out Germany have been funded by the "Yes, I can!" initiative with a total 
of more than 6 million euros since the initiative was launched seven 
years ago.
PROMOTING STEM EDUCATION IN GERMAN
As a future-minded telecommunications and technology company, 
we depend on well-qualified talent, in particular in the STEM areas 
(science, technology, engineering, math). For this reason, we do a lot 
to introduce young people to these subjects, to get them excited about 
them and to improve education in the STEM subjects. It is particularly 
important to us to increase the ratio of women in STEM education. We 
are convinced that diversity helps us remain competitive around the 
world with good ideas and outstanding products and consolidate our 
position as an attractive employer. However, getting young women 
excited about an education in technology remains difficult. In our 
technical cooperative study programs we were able to increase the ratio 
of women from eleven percent in 2010 to 18 percent by the end of 2017 
- but we don't consider this to be enough, by far.

RoboNight in Saarland
During the RoboNights at the University of Applied Sciences (HTW) in 
Saarbrücken students are introduced to technical subjects in a fun way. 
At the RoboNight in November 2017, Deutsche Telekom was not only 
present as a sponsor, but also had a stand presenting future topics such 
as AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality). The participating 
student teams were given tasks in the context of a competition and had 
to solve them with their robots. The winning team got to enjoy a robot kit 
and an invitation to the Telekom Design Gallery in Bonn. There, they 
could see for themselves what will be possible with robots in the future, 
in virtual reality and in the connected home.
STEM projects of Deutsche Telekom Stiftung
Deutsche Telekom Stiftung sponsors STEM education with a number of 
projects, among them the STEM reading mentors, "GestaltBar – the digi-
tal workshop" for students at lower-level secondary schools, the mini-
computer "Calliope Mini" for primary schools, the Junior Engineering 
Academy for secondary-level students (grade eight and higher), Funda-
MINT, a grant program for student teachers. Every year, the foundation 
invites applications for the STEM Didactics Fellowship program from 
young scientists.
EDUCATIONAL STEM ACTIVITIES IN CROATIA
Hrvatski Telekom is a technology leader and it has identified develop-
ments in the labor market, in the economy and in the academic commu-
nity. The company has launched a STEM program that raises the popu-
larity of STEM occupations among university students, with elementary 
and high school students, and also among our employees.
Hrvatski Telekomrecognizes the importance of fostering the interest of 
young people in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). 
In 2017, we therefore continued to focus our activities on strengthening 
this interest.
In 2017, the competition for funding entitled “Together we are Stronger” 
(Zajedno smo jači) concentrated on projects aimed at the education of 
school and university students, educators, and on socially responsible 
innovations. The winner in the category of Youth Education was the 
"HT Campus" project developed by the Astronomical Society Višnjan. 
The monetary prize in the category Teacher/Professor education 
was awarded to the Institute for Youth Development and Innovation for 
the project entitled "Advanced Internet of Things (IoT) Technologies in 
Croatian Schools". The project developed by the Zagreb-based Faculty 
of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture of the University of 
Zagreb entitled "The First Croatian Hydrogen Refueling Station" was 
declared the best in the category of Innovations.
HT STEM HUB
The launch of the HT STEM HUB incubator in 2016 was directed toward 
fostering the development of skills in science, technology, engineering 
and math. The intention is to create an academic and economic com-
munity of young experts, enabling them to realize their professional 
ambitions in Croatia using the most advanced technology with secured 
resources. The STEM program of Hrvatski Telekom facilitates inclusion 
in international projects that are realized within the Deutsche Telekom 
Group inside Croatia.
Hrvatski Telekom was the first organization to bring together several 
individual STEM initiatives. This has involved integrating a number of 
activities to introduce children to interdisciplinary knowledge such as 
robotics and astronomy. We cooperate with STEM faculties and their 
students come to us for practice and mentoring. They then have an 
opportunity to earn a scholarship and excellent associated job opportu-
nities. The students selected for the Faculty of Electrical Engineering 
receive a monthly scholarship of HRK 3,000.
Collaboration with student associations enables us to participate in 
competitions relating to the design of business cases, in career fairs, 
and frequent visits by our specialists to faculties imparting specific 
practical knowledge to students.
A machine learning workshop held during the year for students of the 
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and the Faculty of Science was also 
very successful, and the participants gave favorable feedback.
HACK IT!
We joined forces with hub:raum – Deutsche Telekom’s incubator – 
to organize the “HACK IT!” hackathon. The hackathon is part of our 
broader strategy to enhance STEM activities in Croatia. Ten teams com-
peted to develop the best solution in the field of immersive within the 
space of 24 hours. The main prize was for HRK 30,000 (approx. EUR 
4,000). Out of 125 applications submitted from across the region, the 
10 best teams have been selected to compete in offering the best and 
most comprehensive solution for future communication. Virtual and 
augmented reality, holograms, and artificial intelligence will be included 
in our future communication
The winning team “Tartle” presented an interactive fairy tale for young 
children. The solution uses extended reality to communicate with chil-
dren on smartphones. It "listens" and creates virtual objects and charac-
ters to the keywords in the environment. The team gets access to 
hub:raum programs.
REFUGEE AID: INTEGRATION INTO WORK, INTEGRATION 
INTO SOCIETY
A total of 340 refugees were working at Deutsche Telekom in 2017 – 
primarily as apprentices, interns or as part of the "Internship PLUS 
direct entry" pilot initiative
Deutsche Telekom’s commitment to working with refugees started 
with a first-aid task force in 2015, which provided, for example, free 
Wi-Fi in refugee reception centers and properties to be used as refugee 
housing. In addition, employees were assigned to the Federal Office for 
Migration and Refugees, and employees involved in volunteer refugee 
work received support.

In 2016, the first-aid project developed into the current "Deutsche 
Telekom helps refugees” project. By now, the focus is on integration 
of refugees into the labor market. To this end, we offer internships – 
the first step in getting a foothold in the German labor market. In 2017 
alone, there were 270 new job placements in the various programs. 
Up to 100 training positions, entry-level training schemes and coopera-
tive Bachelor's and Master's programs were offered. We introduced 
recruitment days for the intern selection process, which are more about 
getting to know each other than about perfect prior experience and cer-
tificates. Six recruitment days were held in 2017 at different locations, 
with the majority of the more than 100 internships available being 
awarded on those days. Through recruiting measures, collaboration 
with the 
Federal Employment Agency, communication via social media, volun-
teer workers and refugees who already work for the company, we were 
able to increase the number of applications and increase the ratio of 
applicants to job offers from roughly 2:1 to 5:1.
Internship PLUS direct entry = integration into the working world 
The “Internship PLUS direct entry” pilot initiative, a cooperation with the 
Federal Employment Agency, the Deutsche Post DHL Group and Hen-
kel, also started in 2017. A six month orientation phase is followed by 
a two-year employment. The advantage is that in addition to work, the 
refugees will also have enough time to improve their language skills and 
to find their way step by step into the new job assignment. Overall, we 
have assigned 38 relevant positions at Deutsche Telekom. Four of the 
new employees on this program are supporting customer service with 
their Arabic language skills as part of the "Telekom hilft!” (Telekom 
helps!) team by answering questions through the ArabicTwitter hotline 
that was established in this context.
Grants create opportunities
In 2016, just under 20 refugees took up studies at Deutsche Telekom’s 
own University of Applied Sciences in Leipzig and obtained grants from 
Deutsche Telekom. Moreover, we support the academic education of 
people who took refuge in Germany through the Welcome grant pro-
gram from Deutsche Universitätsstiftung. The program offers refugee 
students in Germany one-on-one counseling with a lecturer from their 
field of study who lives near their university.
Information about Germany: The Handbook Germany
Under www.handbookgermany.de – the further development of our 
refugee portal started in 2015, in cooperation with the Federal Chancel-
lor's office and the New German Media Professionals – refugees find 
information regarding life, learning and working in Germany. The infor-
mation is not only presented in German, but also in other languages 
such as Arabic, English and Persian. Deutsche Telekom supports the 
editing team as a technology partner. Handbook Germany was recog-
nized at the Film Festival Cologne by the "MEDIA & MIGRATION NRW 
2017" project in the category "Best Project of an Initiative/Institution".
For its engagement in the support of millions of Syrian refugees, the 
GSM Association recognized Deutsche Telekom furthermore with the 
Glomo Award 2017 in the category "Outstanding Contribution to the 
Mobile Industry".

"ALL FOR ONE WORLD - ONE WORLD FOR ALL": 
SCHOOL MEETS DEVELOPMENT POLICY
In 2017/2018, we supported the school competition "All for one world - 
one world for all" as an industry partner. The competition aims at sup-
porting the teaching of global development in classes for all ages and 
raising the schoolchildren’s awareness of questions of international 
development. The competition calls on children and young people to 
submit texts, photos, videos, art work, plays or music, posters or even 
digital work. "All for one world - one world for all" is an initiative carried 
out by Engagement Global, under the auspices of the Federal President 
and on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and 
Development.
ANS BOTHA LEARNERSHIP IN SOUTH AFRICA
T-SystemsSouth Africa, digital transformation specialist and technology 
partner to Olympian and400m World Record holder – Wayde van 
Niekerk, is putting its weight behind sustainable job creation for young 
people living with disabilities in South Africa through the Anna Botha 
Learnership program. This program, which comes as part ofT-System’s 
ongoing Nation Building and CSI initiative, is named in honor of Anna 
“Tannie Ans” Botha, Wayde’s coach and mentor.
T-Systemshas launched the Anna Botha Learnership Program in con-
junction with the Wayde Dreamer Foundation, a collaborative initiative 
betweenT-Systemsand Wayde van Niekerk which seeks to uplift the 
youth of South Africa. The program is aimed specifically at young peo-
ple living with disabilities and learning difficulties. It underpins Botha’s 
support for the Foundation’s drive to give something back to those who 
don’t often get the opportunity to better their disabilities. Eleven candi-
dates are accepted into the program as part of the initial trial period. 
Each candidate will graduate with a NQF4qualification in Information 
and Communication Technology Literacy and their A+ certification, 
which will enable them to find suitable employment within the IT field.
The students will undergo full training and certification examinations 
and will emerge from the process with a qualification which will enable 
them to find work in any IT help desk call center or as a field technician, 
among other potential possibilities. Finding employment is particularly 
challenging for individuals living with disabilities not because they are 
incapable, but because they are often denied the opportunities that are 
made available to their able-bodied counterparts.

We want to motivate people to find creative digital solutions to social 
challenges. To do this, we provide tangible support and make it easier 
for them to realize their ideas. Our efforts include, for example, our 
involvement with the "Deutschland sicherimNetz" association and our 
collaboration with the German National Association of Senior Citizen's 
Organisations (BAGSO) to sponsor media literacy projects for seniors. 
Furthermore, we support the development of innovative solutions, such 
as new apps, and we develop our own sustainable products and ser-
vices. We want to be a reliable partner in the era of digitalization, which 
is why we closely evaluate all of the feedback we receive. Our stake-
holder dialog gives stakeholders the opportunity to rate sustainability 
topics according to their importance and assess our performance in 
the different areas. 
PARTNERING WITH "DEUTSCHLAND SICHER IM NETZ" 
AND BAGSO
The Deutschland sicher imNetz e.V. (DsiN) association has served as a 
central point of contact for consumers and small businesses interested 
in the topics of IT security and data privacy for ten years now. Thomas 
Kremer, Deutsche Telekom Board Member for Data Privacy, Legal 
Affairs and Compliance, is chairman of the board at DsiN. As a member 
of the association, we are engaged in the youth competition myDigital-
World and the workshop series IT-Sicherheit@Mittelstand. We also 
participate in the Digital Neighborhood project, which trains people to 
become volunteers sharing their IT knowledge with others. The Digital 
Neighborhood project was presented during the Community Volunteer-
ing Week in September 2017. At the Engagement Market, we presented 
self-study courses for training as a volunteer security and Internet 
trainer.
We promote media literacy among seniors in collaboration with the 
German National Association of Senior Citizen's Organisations, BAGSO. 
As a partner, we sponsored the Internet Gold Award 2017. Further part-
ners are DsiN, Wegeaus der Einsamkeit e.V. (Wade), Google Germany 
and SAP. The award recognizes people over the age of 60 who use the 
Internet skillfully and help others to get started in the online world. The 
Minister of the Interior, Dr. Thomas de Maizière, acted as patron for the 
year 2017. In the context we support one of the winners of the special 
award "Let ideas grow” in implementing their project by providing 
advice and support in public relations and networking.
As an advisory board member we are also involved in the joint Digital-
Kompass project conducted by BAGSO and DsiN. Digital-Kompass 
provides older people and those teaching them to navigate the Internet 
with tried and tested materials.
INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO SOCIAL CHALLENGES
Technology can also be used to address social challenges. This is why 
we support the development of various digital solutions and education 
offers such as the German concussion test app GTE or the "MyShake” 
app, which turns smartphones into earthquake early warning systems. 
In the reporting year, we also supported the following projects:
Supporting dementia research in a fun way with the virtual reality 
game"Sea Hero Quest VR"
Based on the successful mobile game, Deutsche Telekom launched 
a virtual reality version of Sea Hero Quest in 2017. The aim is to bring 
scientists one step closer to the development of new methods for the 
early diagnosis of dementia. Dementia is a big medical challenge, with 
47 million patients as of today. In 2050, there will be three times as 
many.
"Sea Hero Quest Mobile" generated data about the users’ spatial 
navigation ability as the loss of this ability is one of the first symptoms 
of dementia. Based on this data, scientists were able to determine a 
worldwide benchmark of spatial navigation in healthy people. "Sea Hero 
Quest VR" now takes the next step: this innovative format will enable 
much more precise data on spatial navigation ability to be collected 
thanks to its three-dimensional display.
2 percent of all Samsung Gear owners worldwide already have down-
loaded and played the VR game. Overall, by today, over 3.8 million 
people have supported dementia research by playing Sea Hero Quest 
mobile & VR. The initiative shows how digitalization can influence and 
change scientific research in a positive way.
The VR game can be downloaded for free at the Oculus Store and in 
Google Daydream. The mobile game is furthermore available for down-
load in the App Store as well as in Google Play.
Year of voluntary social/digital work: Under the pilot project "Year 
of voluntary social/digital work" (FSJ Digital) in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, 
young people with an interest in media supported non-profit organiza-
tions, such as facilities for seniors and people with disabilities, with 
digital projects and the application of new media. Volunteers received 
media teaching support during their entire time on the program. The 
concept was tested at 25 facilities in Saxony-Anhalt. The program 
offered a wide spectrum of activities ranging from digital storytelling 
to creating accessible web content. The project was sponsored by the 
German Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and 
Youth (BMFSFJ) and supported by Deutsche Telekom and NrEins.de 
AG. The project is being evaluated after completing its second year.

LEVEL" PRIZE
Telekom Albania was awarded the “Contribution to National Level” 
Prize by Partners Albania at a ceremony on 1 December. The award 
acknowledged Telekom’s major contributions supporting social, health-
care and environmental development in Albania. The contributions 
include stocking with books at the public libraries in the City of Tirana, 
donation of medical equipment to the “Shefqet Ndroqi” Hospital and 
the Neurology Service at the ”Mother Theresa” University Hospital 
Center, and the special contribution for research into the fight against

This is the third award of its kind for Telekom Albania. In 2012, an award 
was bestowed on Telekom for its contribution to vulnerable communi-
ties and its long-term engagement in encouraging volunteering initia-
tives. In 2012, Telekom Albania received an accolade for its contribu-
tion to vulnerable groups requiring refurbishment the Retirees’ Home 
in the City of Fier.
EDUCATIONAL ROBOTICS IN GREECE
COSMOTE is a strategic partner of the non-profit organization for edu-
cational robotics, science and technology WRO Hellas and over the 
past three years the Group has been implementing a series of educa-
tional robotics initiatives with the aim of disseminating STEM subjects 
(science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the Greek edu-
cational system. The following initiatives were launched in 2017:
 
The Pan-Hellenic Educational Robotics Competition for primary,  
junior high and high school students was rolled out. More than 
3,500 children participated in the competition and over 1,000 
teachers were trained to enable the students’ teams to design and 
build a complete robotic model.
 
The National WRO Competition was organized with more than 700 
students participating from all over Greece. The winning teams took 
part in the World Robot Olympiad (WRO) held in Costa Rica in 
November 2017. Greek students spent an intensive preparation 
period from the announcement of the WRO in March 2017 until the 
finals in Costa Rica developing critical skills such as teamwork, 
problem-solving, engineering, and programming.
 
The Bronze Medal and significant awards were bestowed on Greek 
teams at the World Robot Olympiad 2017. The SMARTBIRDS NEXT 
team from Patras won aBronze Medaland was ranked third world-
wide (category: "Open Elementary"). This was the 2ndOlympic

Our social commitment reflects our responsibility as a company acting 
in the political, social and business environments. To us, this also means 
encouraging the volunteer efforts of our employees, which contribute 
significantly to strengthening the sense of community. Their voluntary 
community work makes our employees ambassadors of our values. 
Volunteering is also very beneficial when it comes to internal HR devel-
opment. It expands each person's horizon and has a positive impact 
on social skills and teamwork.
That is why we give our employees ample opportunity to volunteer, 
preferably with a focus on teaching media skills. This is just another 
way in which we help simplify and enrich the lives of those around  
us. Supporting our employees ongoing commitment and providing  
incentives for getting involved are two aspects covered by our corporate 
citizenship program, Engagement@telekom.

TAKING RESPONSIBILITY IN OUR SOCIETY
We contribute to society in a number of ways with our corporate citizen-
ship program, engagement@telekom. engagement@telekom is based 
on two pillars:
 
Long-term partnerships with non-profit organizations
 
Corporate volunteering (supporting our employees in their  
volunteering activities) and corporate giving (our donation activities)
In times of digital transformation, we want to be a trusted partner to 
society. We contribute our core expertise and the commitment of our 
employees to these efforts.
Our social commitment often takes the form of longstanding partner-
ships like our partnership with Nummer gegen Kummer (youth coun-
seling line), the Telefonseelsorge crisis helpline, the Lebenshilfe aid 
organization and DKMS, the German Bone Marrow Donor Center. In 
addition, we promote media literacy among seniors in collaboration 
with the German National Association of Senior Citizen's Organisations 
(BAGSO). As a member of Deutschland sicherimNetz e.V. (DsiN), we 
support the association in its work for IT security and data privacy. 
Beyond this, we participate in the Civic Involvement Week sponsored  
by the National Network for Civil Society. We give our employees the 
opportunity to volunteer for social or, with our partners, for environmen-
tal projects, within the scope of our Social Days.
Through corporate volunteering measures, our employees have the 
opportunity to teach media skills. This can be done, for example, in 
cooperation with the Teachtoday initiative, where our employees are 
provided with teaching materials. Another way of getting involved is by 
joining Deutsche Telekom Foundation in its efforts to introduce children 
to the subject of programming using the mini-computer Calliope Mini. 
In addition, we encourage our employees to help integrate refugees into 
society and support them in learning German online under the e-Start 
project. Corporate volunteering is also an important component of our 
training and development activities. The volunteer efforts of our appren-
tices are given special recognition in our Group competition, Responsi-
bility wins!
Our corporate giving concept includes donations for aid organizations 
worldwide, preferably those with which we have longstanding partner-
ships, and fast disaster relief. Our Group Donation Policy lays out the 
guidelines for these activities. For example, we have been collaborating 
with Germany’s Relief Coalition, Aktion Deutschland Hilft, since 2003.
We collaborate closely across country borders when it comes to our 
involvement and share experiences and best practices. We use a set of 
KPIs to measure our success:
 
The Social Commitment ESG KPI reflects our performance. 
 
The Community Investment ESG KPI reflects our social commitment 
in terms of financial, human, and material resources. 
 
The Beneficiaries ESG KPI measures the huge number of active 
contributors as well as the broad target group they reach.

The Media Literacy ESG KPI highlights the high percentage of pro-
jects and activities promoting the competent handling of media. It is 
highly relevant to us as it correlates closely with our core business.
These KPIs are also the basis for our collaboration with partner organi-
zations that help us to continuously control and evaluate our project 
measures and goals. These are monitored closely throughout the pro-
ject year to enable us to adjust our target ranges or goals accordingly.
A study by Beyond Philantrophy and Goetzpartners shows that we are 
one of currently only five Dax 30 companies analyzing the benefits of 
their social commitment. According to this study, only two companies' 
donation activities are clearly related to their core business. In our case, 
this is the promotion of media skills.
In 2017, we assessed to what extent our Corporate Citizenship Program 
contributes to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 
contribution we make to the implementation of the individual SDGs is 
shown in an overview. Apart from this, our network expansion also con-
tributes significantly to the SDGs as it is the basis for connecting people 
and helps, for example, to improve access to education.
INCENTIVES FOR DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY: 
THE DEUTSCHLANDSTIFTUNG INTEGRATION AND START-
STIFTUNG FOUNDATIONS
We are convinced that cultural diversity enriches our society and offers 
opportunities for the innovative strength of our country’s industry. This 
conviction is, for example, reflected in our strategic partnership with  
the German foundation for integration, Deutschlandstiftung Integration. 
The foundation supports young people with a migrant background, 
for example, by helping them to take their first steps into the world of 
work and offering the support of a large network. The patron of the 
foundation is German Chancellor Dr. Angela Merkel. In October 2017, 
Deutschlandstiftung started a cooperation with START-Stiftung. START-
Stiftung has been supporting the integration of young migrants and 
immigrants for 15 years by issuing educational scholarships. The first 
joint events are planned for 2018.
Scholarship program "Go your own way" 
The scholarship and mentor program "Go your own way" of the German 
Foundation for Integration places young people with migration back-
grounds with mentors from politics, business, the media, culture and 
science. We have been a partner of the program since it was launched 
in 2012. Almost 600 mentors support the scholarship recipients in their 
professional and personal lives. So far, they have contributed over 
25,000 hours of volunteer work to this program. The program also offers 
coaching, workshops on specific topics, internship platforms, and net-
work events. In 2017, "Go your own way" celebrated its five-year anniver-
sary and welcomed over 100 new scholarship recipients, so that the 
program now supports a total of about 700 young people.
DIGITAL LITERACY PARTNERSHIPS WITH SCHOOLS IN THE USA
In June of2017,T-Mobile USA launched a new program to provide stu-
dents across the nation with equal access to learning for academic suc-
cess and build the digital skill set that will help them compete in today’s 
digital economy. This new program is called EmpowerED,and it’s a spe-
cial education offering that provides wireless devices and service to 
schools in low-income communities. In the first six months of operation, 
this program provided over13,000devices and lines of service to help 
schools and students succeed.
EmpowerED is a no-cost program for students and their families. All 
data plans includeT-Mobile’s Web Guard CIPA compliant content filter 
that prevents access to adult content through three usage levels that 
include child, teen and young adult. All school systems participating in 
EmpowerED receive planning, implementation and deployment sup-
port.
CORPORATE VOLUNTEERING: OUR EMPLOYEES IN ACTION
Under our Corporate Volunteering program, employees volunteer for 
social action activities. We support this kind of social commitment 
through a variety of projects and events. This enables our employees to 
make valuable contributions to strengthening our society. At the same 
time, however, by volunteering on meaningful projects, they are learning 
new skills, which also has a positive effect on their everyday work. In 
2017, we supported the following projects:
eStart – digital language coaching for refugees
Deutsche Telekom actively supports the e-Start program facilitated by 
the organization Volunteer Vision. At the end of December 2017, 63  
Telekom employees were already helping refugees learn German via a 
video platform. They meet with their students in a video chat once a 
week for one hour. With the help of integrated learning materials, they 
jointly practice homework assignments from a German course.
„Responsibility wins!“
Our "Responsibility wins!" competition gives our apprentices and coop-
erative degree students the opportunity to get involved for the greater 
good and develop their skills beyond the scope of their professional 
training. In 2017, many of them once again participated in a variety of 
projects across Germany, experiencing social responsibility first hand. 
The best projects will be recognized at the end of April 2018 in an 
award ceremony.
STEM reading mentors
In collaboration with the German Reading Foundation, Deutsche  
Telekom Stiftung is looking for volunteer reading mentors to get chil-
dren from the ages of 3 to 10 excited about books with STEM content. 
So far, 1,450 reading mentors have already registered with the network 
– including 73 Deutsche Telekom employees (as of December 2017).
Christmas campaign: Fulfilling children's wishes
In 2017, Deutsche Telekom employees once again volunteered to fulfill 
the Christmas wishes of children and adolescents who live in group 
homes. The children and young people write their name, age and wish 
on a paper star. Each star has a value of €30. Employees take one or 
several stars, buy the desired present, wrap it in Christmas gift wrap, 
and hand it in to the organizational team. Once all presents are gath-
ered, they are handed over to the homes.
Donations for "Ein Herz für Kinder"
Almost 900 Deutsche Telekom employees supported the television 
show in aid of the "Ein Herz für Kinder" children’s charity as volunteers 
at six locations in December of 2017. They volunteered at call centers 
collecting donations from TV viewers over the telephone. In total, over 
€17 million were donated. All the money collected goes to the "Ein Herz 
für Kinder” children’s charity.
Fundraising for "Aktion Deutschland hilft"
At the 2017 Guiding Principles Day, Deutsche Telekom employees 
donated a total of 7,500 euros, which were given to Germany's Relief

Coalition, "Aktion Deutschland Hilft”. The money goes towards projects 
by the member organizations "Help", "Handicap International" and 
"Care".
Moreover, Deutsche Telekom held a Twitter event with the hashtag 
#Magentaverbindet (magenta connects) on December 24, in which it 
donated a base amount of 3,000 euros to "Aktion Deutschland Hilft". 
For each additional tweet under this hashtag, Deutsche Telekom 
donated another euro. At the end of the day, the donation totaled 
4,185 euros.
TELEKOM ALBANIA SUPPORTS ACT NOW
Telekom Albania supported the “Act Now” organization and their 
“Social Glow” project. The aim of this project is to tackle social prob-
lems such as unemployment, poverty, and the exploitation of vulnerable 
groups in the city of Tirana. The project was implemented by setting up 
a coffee bar employing people with disabilities, economic problems, 
and divorced women from rural areas. It serves as a social center where 
workshops, reading nights, and social events are held on a regular 
basis. The center features a separate space where children with special 
needs and performance talents can perform in front of an audience. It is 
open to anyone who needs a space to perform and a potential audience 
to attend.
HELP MEASURED IN KILOMETERS AT T-MOBILE POLAND
Help Measured in Kilometers is a nationwide campaign launched 
in2013and carried out byT-MobilePoland since then. It aims to support 
physically disabled children by providing prostheses and rehabilitation. 
All smartphone users who run, cycle, rollerblade, walk or take part in 
wheelchair sports are able to join the campaign. The kilometers cov-
ered are added together using the free Endomondo Sports Tracker app 
installed by all the participants on their smartphones.
The secret of the campaign’s success is a combination of three ele-
ments: new technologies, a passion for physical activity and a desire 
to help kids. Since the beginning of the campaign, we have been able 
to continuously increase the number of kilometers involved. From gath-
ering 40 million kilometers in 2013, we went to collecting almost 140 
million kilometers in 2016. In 2017, close to 1.4 million participants 
covered almost 140 million kilometers within 92 days, burning 6,670 
million calories in the process.For the fifth time we have turned the kilo-
meters gatheres into zlotys to help children in need. Another million 
zloty was donated to the TVN Foundation “You are not alone”.
DISASTER RESPONSE IN THE USA
2017’s hurricane season topped records on all fronts as Hurricanes 
Maria, Harvey and Irma did catastrophic damage to communities in 
Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. To support customers and maximize 
network availability, T-Mobile USA activated extensive preparation, 
response, and fundraising efforts.
 
Hurricane Preparation: Before any hurricane forecasted to make 
landfall in the US or its territories, T-Mobile sets up an engineering 
command center near the expected area of impact and deployed 
rapid-response teams to minimize potential interruptions to wireless 
service. In addition, T-Mobile’s Geo-Redundant Network Operation 
Centers (NOCs) closely managed network traffic and further coordi-
nate any response to an event.
 
Free Texting & Calling: During the hurricanes and for weeks  
following, T-Mobile offered customers in affected areas the ability 
to call or text anywhere in the US for free. Customers in affected 
areas who were not on the T-Mobile ONE plan were also given 
unlimited data (T-Mobile ONE customers always have unlimited 
data).
 
Text-based Fundraising: T-Mobile promoted ‘Text to Give’ mobile 
phone fundraising to help those impacted by the hurricanes. To par-
ticipate, any consumer could donate USD 10 to the American Red 
Cross for Hurricane disaster relief efforts by texting short codes to 
90999. Several other nonprofit hurricane relief text-to-give options 
were also included.
 
Recovery Efforts: Once recovery efforts began, T-Mobile deployed 
equipment, supplies and disaster experts to all affected areas in all 
three disasters. Emergency equipment included portable genera-
tors, fuel trucks, Cell On Wheels (COWs), Cells on Light Trucks 
(CoLTS), fuel and diesel trucks and other vehicles.
 
Puerto Rico Response: Puerto Rico was especially hard hit by  
Hurricane Maria, and lacked the infrastructure and resources of the 
US mainland. Our immediate support to the island included a dozen 
cargo planes and multiple barges packed full of supplies and equip-
ment, trucks, cells-on-wheels, cells-on-light-trucks and hundreds of 
portable generators. T-Mobile provided the Federal Aviation Admin-
istration a large generator to help keep the San Juan airport open 
allowing for the delivery of life-saving supplies. We sent hundreds of 
emergency and disaster relief experts specializing in the restoration 
of communications networks to the island.
 
Innovative Approaches to Service Restoration: T-Mobile also used 
several innovative technology approaches to restore service. One of 
the solutions was Project Loon, an experimental system that our 
engineering experts worked on with the team at X, Alphabet’s 
Moonshot factory. This balloon-based LTE access allowed us to 
deliver more limited data and texting services to customers in hard 
to reach areas. Another example is our partnership with Vanu, which 
deployed several self-contained portable cellular network units that 
provide voice, data and text capabilities in some of the hardest hit 
areas.

GETTING INVOLVED IN CULTURE AND SPORTS
In Germany, we are one of the leading sponsors of culture and sports, 
and our national companies are also engaged in this area. In addition
 to providing funding, we support artists, athletes, event organizers and 
associations in their communication and marketing activities. Regional 
involvement at our locations also plays a key role.
Sponsoring music is a long-standing tradition at Deutsche Telekom 
and a vital element in our company's brand communication activities. 
It is our goal to give people access to cultural events, thus encouraging 
them to share thoughts and ideas. Our main sponsorship focus is 
placed on events like the Beethovenfest and the International Telekom 
Beethoven Competition in Bonn, which has been providing a stage for 
up-and-coming pianists from all over the world for twelve years.
We are a partner of Junges Theater Bonn and sponsor a number of 
projects, including a media education school project that is aimed at 
motivating young schoolchildren to learn about the new media through 
fun and creative activities.
As part of our sports sponsorship activities, we support both competi-
tive and recreational sports. Our main focus is on soccer partnerships 
with the German Football Association, FC Bayern Munich, and other 
German major league soccer teams. As a Bonn-based company, we 
moreover support the Telekom Baskets Bonn. In addition, we sponsor 
athletes through non-profit organizations such as Deutsche Sporthilfe 
(a German sports aid foundation), Deutscher Behindertensportverband 
(National Paralympic Committee Germany) and DFB-Stiftung Sepp Her-
berger (the German Soccer Association's Sepp Herberger Foundation).
Furthermore, we also place emphasis on those aspects of sports that 
foster community life. The focus of our engagement is on recreational 
sports, school sports programs as well as athletes with disabilities. Our 
partnership with the Deutsche Sporthilfe foundation has been extended 
to 2020, with special emphasis on Paralympic sponsorship and athlete 
career transition.
GETTING EXCITED ABOUT SPORTS WITH THE TELEKOM 
BASKETS
We take responsibility for our immediate social environment, which is 
why we sponsor the Telekom Baskets in Bonn.
Ticket sweepstakes for the Telekom Baskets
Before the 2017/2018 season got underway, we launched our tenth Tix 
for Kids ticket sweepstakes. We raffled off two sets of tickets (2 x 30) for 
each home game. All schools in Bonn had the opportunity to participate 
in the raffle. Bonn-based businesses were invited to become ticket 
sponsors for social welfare institutions, school classes, club teams and 
back-to-work centers for disabled people. We participated in the sweep-
stakes and donated an additional 160 tickets to various organizations 
including the "Maria imWalde" children and youth center, and various 
refugee housing centers.
Baskets@school student training project
Deutsche Telekom's Baskets@school initiative makes it possible for 
students in 5th through 10th grade to have their sports idols visit their 
school. Children and young people experience what professional bas-
ketball training is like by participating in a training session that lasts for 
around 90 minutes. The Telekom Baskets pros teach them tips and 
tricks. Head team trainers offered a total of eight such training sessions 
from November 2017 through April 2018. The project strengthens team 
spirit and teaches students from the region more about basketball.
A highlight of the season was a visit by the Telekom Baskets to the 
Otto-Kühne School rowing club (RVPG). During joint rowing practice 
on the Rhine, the students showed off their talents to the six stars. In a 
following basketball unit, the Baskets pros showed off their skills in the 
court.
Baskets Primary School Challenge
In 2017, we started the Baskets Primary School Challenge together 
with the Telekom Baskets and in cooperation with the City of Bonn.  
This training project wants to get second and third graders excited 
about sports and awaken their athletic ambition. The students are given 
the opportunity to train with Telekom Baskets players – and to then 
compete with other primary schools in a challenge. Deutsche Telekom 
furthermore provides a free box with training equipment that the 
schools may keep after the end of the project. Interested primary school 
classes from Bonn and its surroundings may register online. The finale 
of the first challenge took place in January of 2018 at the Telekom 
Dome.

PROGRAMS FOR YOUNG SOCCER TALENT
"Stollenhelden" (Soccer Heroes), Deutsche Telekom's soccer program 
for future stars, had evolved from the ANSTOSS! soccer initiative. With 
the election of the Stollenhelden (Soccer Heroes) 2017, we have ended 
the project in January of 2018 after four years. We continue to support 
the development of new soccer talent through the "New Sports Experi-
ence" program.
New Sports Experience
We run the "New Sports Experience" development program in collabo-
ration with the National Paralympic Committee Germany and the 
National Soccer Association's Sepp Herberger Foundation. The "blind 
soccer" training unit gives teams with players 12 years and older an 
opportunity to experience something new and to learn how to play blind 
soccer. In the "blind stadium experience" students with and without 
visual impairments attend a German national league soccer game 
together, following the action by only hearing the live commentary. 
This experience promotes camaraderie among young people.
SPORT IS GOOD CAMPAIGN IN ROMANIA
The “Biggest Sports Hour” 2017
During June and July 2017, Telekom Romania in partnership with 
SmartAtletic organized the 7th edition of the sports event “The Biggest 
Sports Hour” in Bucharest, Brașov, and Mamaia. The event was attended 
by more than 50,000 people from 21 cities in Romania. It featured 
around 35 fitness classes, coordinated by 118 instructors, and 18 
sports such as: cycling, street workout, freewheel, table tennis, football, 
etc.
In addition, 3 medical stations were provided by BTL Romania. They 
carried out more than 500 ECG tests for the detection of sudden death 
syndrome, and medical aesthetic sessions. The Red Cross offered first 
aid and resuscitation courses for 100 children and adults, while the 
Leventer Foundation provided tests for skin cancer.
Last but not least, the Telekom Romania Foundation supported two 
charitable causes throughout the event: 40 families without income 
from Giurgiu County received non-perishable food and the Casa 
Speranţei Hospice for children and adults with incurable diseases 
received financial donations gathered through the "Sport is good" cross, 
part of "The Biggest Hour of Sport" event in Brașov.
Telekom Romania supports the third edition of Brasov International 
Marathon
In May 2017, Telekom Romania organized the Brasov International 
Marathon as part of the “Sport Is Good” campaign. More than 2,600 
national and international runners of all ages competed in the marathon 
(+26% more than in 2016).

CULTURAL SPONSORSHIPS: PROMOTING ACCESS TO ART
With the exhibition "Henry Moore.Vision Creation. Obsession", we 
would like to facilitate access to art for people from different social 
backgrounds and sponsor the art and media competence of children 
and adults. The exhibition took place from May 2017 to January 2018 
at the Arp Museum Bahnhof Rolandseck in Remagen near Bonn. In 
cooperation with the museum's public outreach department, we offered 
a variety of workshops in which visitors were able to not only contem-
plate art, but to get creative themselves and improve their digital media 
skills with photo or video apps.
Moreover, Deutsche Telekom provided an allotment of 50 free tickets 
for charitable organizations and holders of the Bonn Card. The Bonn 
Card allows low-income citizens of Bonn to access certain services and 
reduced fees. For Bonn-based social institutions and organizations, 
Deutsche Telekom also held free photo rallies across the Arp Museum 
grounds. The end of the year-long exhibition was formed by the "Magic 
of Advent Weekend" that we held in cooperation with Junges Theater 
Bonn. In four acting taster workshops at the museum, participants had 
fun bringing Henry Moore sculptures to life.
A UNIQUE CONCERT EXPERIENCE: BEETHOVENFEST AND 
JAZZFEST
Beethovenfest Bonn: Deutsche Telekom presents inspiring concert 
evenings
In 2017, we were once again the main sponsor of the Beethovenfest in 
Bonn, which was inspired by the motto "The Distant Beloved" this time. 
We sponsored two fascinating concert evenings. On September 30, 
the Musiciens du Louvre orchestra, conducted by Sébastien Rouland, 
played works by Joseph Haydn, Hector Berlioz, Charles Gounod and 
Jacques Offenbach at the World Conference Center Bonn. Another 
concert evening was presented by Francesco Tristanoon September 16.

The pianist combines classical music with techno in his shows. The 
concert was organized by eight students within the scope of the student 
manager project of the Young Beethovenfest. The students handled 
financing and advertising and made sure the concert runs smoothly. 
Beethovenfest employees assisted the students in all of their responsi-
bilities. 2017 was already the seventh time that Deutsche Telekom has 
sponsored this project.
Moreover, during the period covered by this report, we held another 
International Telekom Beethoven Competition for pianists. The competi-
tion has been held every other year since 2005. We sponsor young pro-
fessional pianists and offer them an international forum. We specifically 
expect of the participants that they imbue their performances with their 
own interpretations and ideas. The awards were given out in December 
2017.
Jazzfest Bonn
We were also once again a main sponsor of last year's Jazzfest Bonn 
in May 2017, where we presented a double concert at the sold-out 
Telekom Forum on May 12. The audience greatly enjoyed the perfor-
mances by actress Jasmin Tabatabai, accompanied by the David Klein 
Quartett, and by the jazz/rap group Jazzkantine.
FOSTERING CULTURE AND DIGITIZATION IN GREECE
Free WiFi Services at 20 Top Archaeological Sites and Museums  
in Greece
In cooperation with the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sport, COSMOTE 
has launched the provision of free WiFi at 20 archaeological sites and 
museums throughout Greece. By 2017, Wi-Fi access was already in 
place at the Acropolis, Delphi, Akrotiri on Santorini, the Knights’ Palace 
and Archeology Museum on Rhodes, the Athens Byzantine Museum, 
Eleftherna Museum on Crete, and at the Delos museum and archeologi-
cal site. The archeological sites at Knossos and Sounio, the Royal 
Tombs (Vergina), the National Archeological Museum, Ancient Olympia, 
the Archeological Museums at Heraklion and Thessaloniki, the Acropo-
lis on Lindos, Ancient Epidaurus, the Acropolis of Mycenae, Spinaloga, 
the Museum of Byzantine Culture, ancient Dodoni, and ancient Corinth 
will be the next sites to go online. COSMOTE is investing more than € 2 
million to harness the power of technology and promote Greek cultural 
heritage. The project includes the study, design, and development of 
wireless network infrastructures at selected locations by the Ministry of 
Culture and Sport, provision of the necessary equipment, operation and 
maintenance of the networks, and free wireless Wi-Fi internet for three 
years. Free WiFi provision will be completed in the course of 2018.
Contemporary Artistic Creation at the Onassis Foundation
The OTE Group supports the Onassis Foundation with the aim of pro-
moting more than 120 productions in the field of culture. The focus here 
is on contemporary art. In 2017, COSMOTE focused on supporting the 
exhibition "Science Fiction: Travel to the Unknown". This included crea-
tions by modern artists inspired by the opportunities of science fiction 
in design, cinema, and literature. The exhibition also included concerts, 
educational programs, workshops and film screenings. At the same 
time, COSMOTE is supporting the upgrade for the application entitled 
"Soundscapes – Landscapes 2". This enables visitors to take part in a 
poetic journey of sound and image around the streets of the city using 
tablets and smartphones.

Dear Readers,
The changes we have experienced in the onward march of the digital 
revolution have meant no less than a remapping of our world – bringing 
radical rupture to every area of our lives. These changes are opening up 
unimagined new opportunities. But we also need to ensure that people 
remain at front and center during this digital upheaval.
We at Deutsche Telekom are in the avant-garde of the digital revolution, 
pushing on change with our products and services, yet at the same time 
also keenly aware of the need to keep up the same pace in achieving 
our own transformation. That is why we are searching for ways to find 
the right balance in the changes happening in our company, and to take 
our employees on the journey with us. A positive attitude to change is 
fundamental, and that is why we are providing opportunities in the digi-
tal workplace and supporting co-workers by providing the right sort of 
environment. We are also establishing a new culture of knowledge and 
of learning from error that provides the freedom to keep up with the blis-
tering pace of change.
In some places we need the courage to dare to try out the new. And that 
is why I urge you to “just go ahead and do it”! That is the reason we are 
creating new spaces for experimentation in which we can try out new 
possibilities – without organizational and operational pressures.
One of these spaces for experimentation is the 80/20 model. It offers 
the freedom to employees to dedicate 20 percent of their work time on 
projects not directly connected to their regular duties. In the manage-
ment area too we are exploring new terrain; things that used to be run 
by command and control supervision often just do not work that way 
anymore. The growing complexity and volatility of the digitalization pro-
cess is forcing us to abandon our tried-and-tested leadership models.  
In particular, the concept of “lifelong learning” is acquiring even greater 
weight as the digital revolution moves forward. And that is why we are 
developing digital tools that help put the fun into learning – including 
the use of gamification and virtual reality, for example. And we have 
already tried out both successfully.
Technological progress cannot be stopped. But it can be shaped to  
our needs. And the way digitization is reshaping our world will, as men-
tioned above, surely lead to social innovations – innovations that will 
especially affect our working lives. Aside from the examples I mention 
here, we have set out a few thoughts in a position paper on how we can 
prepare for the future of Deutsche Telekom right now.
I am convinced that flexibility is set to become the "new normal". Firmly 
embedded in a responsible corporate culture, it gives us the key to the 
successful digital transformation of work.

SHAPING CHANGE AT THE COMPANY 
Digitalization is revolutionizing the way we work. Today, we are seeing 
new ways of cooperating and an increased degree of automation. 
Employees are expected to offer more flexibility, social competence, 
and personal responsibility. They also need to be life-long learners and 
be more self-directed. We have made it our goal to help our employees 
make these changes – and to help them not only manage change, but 
also take an active role in shaping it. Co-determination rights play a 
key role in this. Hence, we pursue dialog-oriented employee relations 
throughout the Group and engage in trust-based, constructive collabo-
ration with employee representatives and unions.
Fair pay and benefits
We offer our employees competitive, performance-based pay oriented 
to the relevant national market. Our remuneration policies are struc-
tured to guarantee equal pay for men and women and do not discrimi-
nate. Executive compensation at Deutsche Telekom is based on our 
Group-wide Global Compensation Guideline. We also offer our employ-
ees additional benefits such as our company pension scheme. We regu-
larly poll our employees' satisfaction with their remuneration with the 
employee survey and also conduct surveys on specific topics and in 
specific units. We have compiled a separate report in order to comply 
with the new legal requirements of the Act to Promote Transparency of 
Pay Structures. This is enclosed to the management report as an appen-
dix.
Flexible working models
Having the chance to structure one's work according to one's own 
needs considerably improves work-life balance and helps prevent stress 
and the feeling of being overworked. That is why we actively promote 
flexible working time models. Our offer ranges from flexitime and part-
time to lifetime work accounts. Since 2016 we have offered about 
80,000 employees in Germany a so-called lifetime work account. This 
offer has been available to about 20,000 civil servants in Germany since 
mid-2017. This amounts to 90 percent of all employees in Germany. 
Lifetime work accounts give our employees the opportunity to finance 
future absences from work lasting longer than one month, which may 
be used for early retirement, a sabbatical or to support a period of part-
time work. Executives have had this option since 2012. We set up 9,000 
lifetime work accounts by the end of 2017. What's more, we created the 
prerequisite for establishing mobile working as a new way of working at 
our company when we concluded the sector-specific collective agree-
ment on mobile working in 2016.
Socially responsible personnel restructuring
We must continually develop as a company in order to fulfill our custom-
ers' requirements. This also means quantitative and qualitative staff 
restructuring at some of our companies. The main objective is to struc-
ture these changes for our employees in a socially responsible manner. 
At the companies affected, for example, we decided to enter into collec-
tive agreements that rule out compulsory redundancies. Within the 
scope of this socially responsible staff restructuring, we employ alterna-
tive tools such as severance payments and phased retirement as well 
as training programs that help our employees prepare for new assign-
ments.
Employee satisfaction and participation
We highly encourage a feedback culture throughout the Group and pro-
mote open dialog and constructive communication with our employees 
Our social network "You and Me" (YAM), the Group-wide network that 
has about 123,000 users, is an important tool for this. YAM provides not 
only comprehensive information but also a platform for our employees 
to engage in cross-hierarchical dialog and raise topics that are impor-
tant to them for discussion within the Group. Our Board of Management 
also regularly uses YAM as a platform for direct dialog. Another key ele-
ment of our feedback culture is our Group-wide employee survey. This 
is supplemented by pulse surveys, which give us a snapshot of the 
mood at the company twice a year. Our Group-wide ideas management 
activities are another key tool in encouraging employee contributions to 
the success of the company.
We have seen an increase in the number of employees participating in 
our Group-wide pulse surveys as well as our ideas management activi-
ties. In 2017, 71 percent of our employees took part in the pulse survey 
(previous year: 73 percent). Employee satisfaction remained high at 72 
percent. Interest in ideas management is also very good; statistically, 
every eleventh employee submitted a new idea in 2017. We also offer

our employees opportunities to help shape our corporate social 
commitment within the scope of corporate volunteering initiatives.
We have set Group-wide standards for managing employee relations. 
These were formalized in our Guiding Principles, Leadership Principles 
and Employee Relations Policy. You can find additional information 
about respect for human rights at our Group in the Strategy chapter.
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS AT OUR NATIONAL COMPANIES 
What progress have our national companies been making in implement-
ing our Employee Relations Policy? We determine such progress using 
special reviews. Two to three national companies are subject to such a 
review each year. They use the results of the review to further improve 
their relations with employees. The results also help us conduct a 
Group-wide assessment of employer/employee relations and any 
human rights risks involved in our business activities.
In 2017 we conducted reviews at T-Systems Netherlands and IT 
Services Hungary, a subsidiary of T-Systems International. We publish 
the results on our website.
Extensive discussions with management and numerous employees of 
T-Systems Netherlands showed that all elements of the ER policy intro-
duced in 2011 had been successfully implemented. The employees 
proved to be very satisfied with their employer and praised both cooper-
ation within their team and with management. The respondents sug-
gested additional measures regarding communication of the com-
plaints procedure, the ER policy, and the Guiding Principles as part of 
the ER policy. For example, they recommended that these topics be 
communicated even more intensively at events such as the Guiding 
Principles Day.
At IT Services Hungary (ITSH), the key elements of the policy have been 
successfully integrated into day to day business, and employees are 
familiar with these elements. Management has also focused in particu-
lar on reconciling work and family life, among other things, due to the 
large amount of young employees. A Working from Home policy was 
introduced in 2014. During the 2017 review process, the respondents 
indicated they would like additional options for flexible working sched-
ules, such as tandem or part-time work. In 2017 ITSH was selected by 
the global service company Aon as the company with the best 
employee program and the most dedicated employees in Hungary. This 
award is given to companies that are particularly attractive employers.
SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE STAFF RESTRUCTURING CONTINUED 
The transformation of our Group was a key issue in past years and will 
continue to be so in coming years. Against the backdrop of digitaliza-
tion and the associated changes, we must secure our long-term viability 
and competitiveness. This process is connected to complex staff 
restructuring. We are creating new jobs in growth fields and are training 
qualified personnel to fill these positions. Other areas are the focus of 
restructuring activities involving workforce reduction. We make sure 
that all restructuring measures are implemented in a socially responsi-
ble way for our employees. In doing so, we try to support them in the 
best way possible on our way to the digitalized working world.
Integrated staff restructuring management introduced at Telekom 
Deutschland GmbH
Over the course of the upcoming changes, our goal is to provide even 
more professional assistance to employees during their professional 
reorientation phase. That is why integrated staff restructuring manage-
ment was introduced in the Germany segment, which should be effec-
tive early on in the restructuring process. This means that in cases 
where tasks could be canceled or different skills could be required for 
certain positions, we want to take preemptive steps and consult with the 
affected colleagues and managers much earlier than we have in the 
past. During such consultation, various employment alternatives are 
devised together with the affected employees and their specific poten-
tial labor markets are ascertained. Added to this is comprehensive 
assistance with developing an individual job application approach and 
– if necessary – targeted planning and implementation of skills develop-
ment measures.
Civil servanttransfer 
Accompanying the above measures, Vivento, our internal service pro-
vider for Deutsche Telekom's staff restructuring measures in Germany, 
will continue to help civil servants transfer to positions in public service. 
About 450 civil servants employed at Deutsche Telekom opted for a 
permanent transfer to federal, state or local authorities in 2017. In 2017 
the focus was primarily on transfers of civil servants to the Federal 
Employment Agency, branches and field offices of the Federal Office for 
Migration and Refugees and to the Federal Armed Forces. Employees 
were assisted in finding positions with federal, state and local adminis-
trative authorities.
New framework conditions for staff restructuring at T-Systems
Competition in the worldwide ICT market and the changes resulting 
from digitalization are creating major challenges for us. This necessi-
tated a collective agreement for 2016 and 2017 that does not place 
any additional strain on T-Systems' competitiveness and supports staff 
restructuring measures. The collectively agreed upon moratorium on 
compulsory redundancies will last until December 31, 2018. As an 
employer, we continued to make significant investments in the neces-
sary socially acceptable staff restructuring measures in 2017.T-Systems' 
goal is competent, employee-oriented change management that ena-
bles employees affected by staff restructuring to undergo professional 
reorientation and effective reintegration. Negotiations with employee 
representatives regarding framework regulations for the staff restructur-
ing process took place at the end of 2016. The central works agreement 
on supporting and implementing staff restructuring at T-Systems Inter-
national (CWA on Staff Restructuring 3.0) was revised in March 2017. It 
defines HR instruments as well as processes and procedures for carry-
ing out compulsory staff-related measures. The Job Service & Place-
ment (JSP) service launched in 2014 will continue to support affected 
employees in finding new jobs. The cooperation with JSP is set forth in 
T-Systems' Central Works Agreement on Change Management.
Transformation measures were necessary at the TC Division and IT 
Division in 2017. This change resulted in a moderate loss of jobs. The 
reconciliation of interests required for this were negotiated with the 
relevant department representatives. Here too, assistance with helping 
employees find new employment opportunities is important so as to 
ensure that the restructuring process remains socially responsible.

Thanks to JSP, T-Systems was able to find new career perspectives for 
50 percent of the 188 affected employees.
JSP's success stories in past years were also noticed by other Group 
units. As a result, JSP took over advisory activities for 25 Telekom Train-
ing employees and has already found solutions for 75 percent of them. 
Since September 2017, JSP has additionally been supporting the inter-
nal staff restructuring process of the Europe Board department and has 
achieved initial success in advising both employees and managers.
Reorientation of Telekom Deutschland GmbH
Telekom Deutschland successfully completed its transformation pro-
gram in 2017. The goal of the reorientation was to make the unit more 
competitive by changing its structure. To this end, Telekom Deutschland 
concentrated on processes and interfaces that directly affect custom-
ers. The transformation project consists of three large organizational 
key elements. First, a new service organization was created that 
includes most of the operational back office – customer service and 
technical service. Hence services for consumer, business and carrier 
customers now come from one source. Second, a new sales organiza-
tion was created for business customers from the sales units of the busi-
ness customer segment, while the sales organization for consumers 
was rebranded and expanded. Technical service units were integrated 
into Deutsche Telekom Technik so that network expansion would be 
managed entirely by this company. On July 1, 2017, about 20,000 col-
leagues moved to the new units by way of transfer of operations, job 
offer process, transfer, assignment or temporary leave from civil-servant 
status. The last steps of reorganization and transfer of operations were 
completed at the turn of 2017/2018.
In order to promote Telekom Deutschland's targeted transformation, a 
needs-based staffing strategy was developed, consisting of three ele-
ments: staff cuts, restructuring and safeguarding the company’s future. 
The strategy entails monitoring of how requirements change over time 
in the individual companies and units. This is the basis for planning 
ideal headcount development. To this end, Telekom Deutschland uses 
a forward-looking competence management concept that analyzes 
which skills will be in demand in the future. The concept allows a rea-
sonable assessment of the areas where staff cuts or recruitment should 
take place and of how existing skills need to be managed and missing 
skills need to be added. In addition, this helps to transfer employees to 
new positions, also beyond their own departments, and ensure system-
atic succession management. The year 2017 also saw new impetus for 
transfers to a different employment relationship – such as by making 
phased retirement more flexible, which can now last between two and 
eight years. Special severance packages are also still on offer, espe-
cially for managers.
Telekom Deutschland is also going down new paths with respect to 
working hours. "Breathing working time" is one example of this. This 
concept enables flexible response to fluctuation in workload, such as 
during network expansion activities. In order to introduce the new 
model, a collective agreement was concluded with ver.di as a basis for a 
temporary increase in weekly working hours. Next, specific regulations 
were agreed with the works councils of six technology units. These reg-
ulations have been applicable for about 2,600 employees since April 
2017. This way, a "breathing capacity" of around 150 employees was 
created, enabling a flexible response to special requirements. This con-
cept is scheduled to be expanded in the technology units.
FLEXIBLE WORKING HOUR SCHEMES EXPANDED FURTHER 
We offer a wide range of optional working models tailored to the needs 
of specific target groups. These are based on the laws and regulations 
applicable in the individual countries. Working hours at the Group com-
panies in Germany are governed by collective agreements and works 
agreements. Daily working hours are electronically recorded for employ-
ees who are covered by collective agreements. This guarantees compli-
ance with legal and company regulations; for example, it makes sure 
that the weekly working hours for a specific flexitime balancing period 
are complied with. At a large corporation such as ours, regulations are 
diverse and cannot be fully specified for all the Group companies.
Our flexible and innovative working time models were honored with an 
award in 2017: the Time-to-Change project received the Pillar World 
Award. The project consists of three individual measures: tandem, right 
of return from part-time work and additional days off. Deutsche Telekom 
Services GmbH received Gold in the "Employer of the Year" category 
and silver in the "Best Products & Services of the Year" category.
Promoting part-time work
Working based on various part-time models is a concept that is estab-
lished throughout the Group. We have offered our employees a return to 
work guarantee since 2014, with employees being able to return to their 
original weekly working hours at any time. To promote part-time work for 
executives as well, we adopted a policy to this end in 2010. A total of 27 
executives throughout Germany were working part-time as of December 
31, 2017. Deutsche Telekom also made a similar voluntary commitment 
regarding employees covered by collective agreements and civil serv-
ants. What's more, 14 percent of employees covered by collective 
agreements and 20 percent of civil servants were working based on 
part-time models as of December 31, 2017. In 2017 we developed 
another part-time model for our employees in Germany, which we refer 
to as "additional days off" and which is scheduled to go into effect in 
2018. This model enables part-time employees to accumulate addi-
tional days off. We also offer a number of additional part-time options 
for reducing working hours such as job sharing, in which two or more 
employees share a position. This option can be employed using a job 
splitting model where each employee is responsible for different tasks 
or via job pairing, where employees share responsibility for one area.
Mobile working
Mobile working is the normal state of affairs at Deutsche Telekom. We 
laid the foundations for this back in 2016. Deutsche Telekom and ver.di 
agreed on the first collective agreement on mobile working concluded 
by an employer association, which includes rules regarding telecom-
muting and mobile working, among others. Thanks to increased geo-
graphic flexibility, our employees have more freedom to plan their work, 
thereby gaining more job satisfaction and increasing productivity - and 
allowing them to achieve a better work-life balance.
Lifetime work accounts
Since 2016 we have offered about 80,000 employees in Germany so-
called lifetime work accounts. About 20,000 civil servants in Germany 
have had this option available to them since 2017, which allows them to 
finance a future leave of absence lasting more than one month. The 
account may be used for early retirement, a sabbatical or to support a 
period of part-time work. Our employees can finance their lifetime work 
account either from their gross salary or with time credits converted into 
monetary amounts. Until 2018 we will also support employees who are

below a certain income limit with an annual contribution. We had 
already set up 8,629 accounts for employees and 575 accounts for civil 
servants by the end of 2017.
Phased retirement
We offer all Group employees over the age of 54 the option of phased 
retirement. Separate regulations apply for employees and for civil serv-
ants. Phased retirement can be taken either based on the block or the 
part-time model. Unlike regular part-time regulations, we make a sub-
stantial top-up payment to the employees' part-time pay with our phased 
retirement offer. This means that reducing their weekly hours does not 
equate to a proportionately high reduction in net pay for employees. 
During the reporting year, a total of 1,747 phased retirement contracts 
were concluded with employees both covered and not covered by c
ollective agreements. Among civil servants there were 580 such con-
tracts.
Part-time training for single parentsWe have been offering single par-
ents up to the age of 25 the opportunity to complete a training program 
or cooperative course of study part-time at Deutsche Telekom in Ger-
many since 2011 in collaboration with the German Federal Employment 
Agency 22 young people began their part-time training with this pro-
gram in 2017.
Re-entry into the workforce after parental leaveWe offer all Group 
employees the option of re-entering the workforce with part-time work 
after parental leave.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2016 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING 
ROUND AND OTHER HARMONIZATIONS IN 2017 
In the course of the 2016 collective bargaining round, the second phase 
of salary increases was successfully implemented for the majority of 
Deutsche Telekom employees in Germany.
 
Starting in 2016, the salaries of roughly 60,000 employees covered 
by collective agreements at Deutsche Telekom AG and in the Ger-
many operating segment were raised in two phases by a total of 4.7 
percent for employees in the lower pay groups and 4.3 percent for 
employees in the higher pay groups. After the first increase in 2016, 
the second increase took place on April 1, 2017. The duration of the 
new collective wage agreements is 24 months and they are sched-
uled to end on January 31, 2018.
 
Salaries at T-Systems for some 20,000 employees under collective 
agreements will be raised in two phases by a total of 3 percent for 
employees in the lower pay groups and a total of 2.5 percent for 
employees in the higher pay groups. After the first increase in 2016, 
the second increase took place on April 1, 2017. The collective 
wage agreement has a term of 24 months and will expire on March 
31, 2018.
 
The wages of apprentices and students in cooperative study pro-
grams will also be increased in two phases. After the first increase  
in 2016 by EUR 35.00, another increase of EUR 25.00 followed on 
April 1, 2017. Subsistence allowance for apprentices not living with 
their parents was increased by EUR 23 for all those eligible.
 
The standardization and harmonization of our German remunera-
tion systems adopted in the 2016 collective bargaining round was 
further driven forward. The first successful collective bargaining 
took place in 2017; the results will be implemented on January 1, 
2018 and January 1, 2019. Collective bargaining on additional  
harmonization topics will take place in 2018.
GREAT INTEREST IN EMPLOYEE SURVEY 
Our employee survey, which is conducted every two years, is an impor-
tant tool for obtaining feedback from our employees, discovering weak-
nesses and implementing suitable measures to eliminate those weak-
nesses. The twice-yearly pulse survey additionally helps us obtain a 
current snapshot of the mood at the company and verify whether the 
introduced measures have been successful. This lets us make quick 
adjustments if necessary.
Some 75 percent of employees throughout the Group took part in the 
2017 employee survey. The Group index value for commitment – our 
gage for employee satisfaction – was 4.1 on a scale of 1 to 5, with five 
being the highest. The pulse survey in November 2017 saw a 71 per-
cent response rate among employees. 72 percent of participants 
expressed high satisfaction with their employer.
TRUST-BASED COOPERATION WITH EMPLOYEE 
REPRESENTATIVES 
Co-determination rights play a key role with respect to digital transfor-
mation. We want to create the working world of the future alongside 
employee representatives and unions – with an eye towards the needs 
of our workforce and the success of our company. We negotiated and 
signed over 200 agreements in 2017 through constructive dialog with 
our works councils. One key project was the organizational measure 
"Einfach Anders” (Simply different), which focused on a re-alignment of 
the entities within the Germany operational segment of the Group. The 
new organizational structure allowed us to harmonize the management 
of service responsibilities combined within the Service board depart-
ment, to establish a customer-centric sales process for consumers and 
business customers in separate sales entities, and to combine the activi-
ties for the network build-out in a single entity. We concluded another 
65 collective agreements with the union ver.di in 2017. In order to make 
phased retirement an even more attractive option for leaving working 
life early with sufficient social security, a general collective agreement 
on phased retirement was concluded in 2017 between Arbeitgeberver-
bandfürTelekommunikation und IT e.V. (agvcomunitye.V., the employ-
ers' association for the telecommunications and IT industry) and the ver.
di union.
The works councils, central works councils and Group Works Council 
represent the interests of our employees at our Group in Germany. Our 
partner at a European level is the European Works Council. We also 
have executive staff representation committees and disabled employee 
representatives at the unit, company and Group level. Collective bar-
gaining plays an important role and has a long tradition at our company, 
a fact made clear by the percentage of employees covered by collective 
agreements. As of December31, 2016, some 69percent of employees 
in Germany were covered by collective agreements.

Constructive dialog with T-Mobile USA
As the underlying laws and contracts vary from country to country, 
codetermination matters with trade unions and employee representa-
tives are managed locally. Group management is involved in all major 
issues as a matter of principle.
We carefully monitored trade union issues in the USA operational seg-
ment in 2017 and discussed individual cases in dialog with the manage-
ment of T-Mobile USA. The responsibility for national Human Resources 
Management matters lies with the management of T-Mobile USA. This 
responsibility is administered with a high degree of dedication and 
accompanied by excellent customer satisfaction results. In a US-wide 
survey of 360,000 customers by market research institute HarrisX, 
T-Mobile USA received the highest customer satisfaction ratings among 
all network operators in the US for all four quarters of 2017.
Deutsche Telekom respects freedom of association and the right to 
collective bargaining in accordance with national regulations. This 
naturally applies to the USA as well. All employees at T-Mobile USA 
have the right to form and join a trade union. At the same time, employ-
ees are free to choose not to do so. T-Mobile USA will not exert any 
influence on this decision and will not favor or impede employees 
based on their choice.
The results of the employee survey in 2017 showed that 93 percent of 
employees are proud to work for T-Mobile USA. Some 88 percent would 
recommend T-Mobile USA as an attractive employer, and 84 percent 
feel inspired by the company such that they go beyond their normal job 
requirements to make the company more successful. These results are 
some of the highest in the entire Group.
TMUS has also been honored with a Glassdoor Employees’ Choice 
Award, recognizing the Best Places to Work in 2018. The Employees’ 
Choice Awards program, now in its 10th year, relies solely on the input 
of employees, who elect to provide feedback on their jobs, work envi-
ronments and companies via Glassdoor. More than four out of five 
(81%) T-Mobile USA employees say they recommend the company to 
a friend. This is the highest percentage of any company in the US 
mobile communications industry. In addition to this award from Glass-
door, T-Mobile USA received further recognitions for Best Places to 
Work throughout 2017.
GOOD PARTICIPATION IN GROUP-WIDE IDEA GENERATION MAN-
AGEMENT
Many employees once again took part in idea generation management 
in 2017. In Germany, every 15th employee submitted a new idea, giving 
us a continually high participation rate. The economic benefit translated 
into a total of 99 million euros in cost savings and tapping of new busi-
ness potential. With a total of 6,902 new ideas, employees again proved 
the great extent of their interest in helping shape the Group through cre-
ativity and commitment. They also make an important contribution to 
Deutsche Telekom's target objectives.
Two of our employees' ideas came up winners of the Idea Management 
Award 2017 bestowed by the German Institute for Idea and Innovation 
Management:
Bernd Zopf was awarded second place in the "Best Idea of 2017 from 
Production and Technology" category with his idea "Laying fiber-optic 
cables in the ventilation tubes of existing copper main cables".
Markus Cremer was awarded third place in the "Best Idea of 2017 from 
Management and Administration" category with his idea "Reducing the 
mast replacement rate by using an additional testing tool". Based on 
this idea, the mast replacement rate can be reduced from 14 percent to 
10 percent, so the idea makes a significant contribution to conserving 
resources and reducing cost.
WE HONOR THE SERVICE OF OUR LONGTIME EMPLOYEES 
In September 2017, we honored the commitment of our employees 
celebrating their 25th, 40th and 50th service anniversaries at Telekom 
Deutschland with a central Anniversary Celebration Week . The idea for 
Anniversary Celebration Week came about in 2008 in the customer ser-
vice department and was expanded year after year due to positive 
employee response and importance to our corporate culture. The year 
2017 also marked the first time that the employees of Telekom Technik 
Deutschland joined the central festivities, as previously these employ-
ees had been honored at regional celebrations. Eligible T-Systems 
employees were also welcomed to the joint celebrations for the first time 
this year. The former HR Director of Telekom Deutschland, Martin Seiler, 
the HR Director of T-Systems, Georg Pepping, as well as Member of the 
Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom AG and CEO of T-Systems, 
Reinhard Clemens, were all present at the celebrations.
More than 3,000 eligible employees were invited in 2017, with about 
1,400 of them attending the event in Bonn personally. A total of 43,650 
years of work and experience at Bundespost and Telekom were repre-
sented at our forum in Bonn during the four-day event. The excellent 
cooperation between our colleagues, both young and old, is a key pillar 
of our business success. That's because learning from each other, being 
interested in each other's ideas and growing and working out solutions 
together are basic conditions in professional life.

Measures that promote health within the company not only help individ-
ual employees and ensure long-term business success, but also have 
positive effects on society as a whole. We use corporate health manage-
ment to take on social responsibility and proactively promote a culture 
of health. We support our employees in maintaining their health and 
occupational safety with a host of target-audience-specific measures 
and extensive prevention programs. In doing so, we consider the statu-
tory requirements to be only the minimum standard we must achieve.

PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF OUR WORKFORCE 
Our health management strategy is designed to maintain and promote 
our employees’ health and performance. We view occupational health 
and safety legislation as minimum requirements.
Incorporating health and safety management throughout the Group
Our corporate occupational health and safety measures are effectively 
incorporated into our structures via certified management systems and 
appropriate policies and guidelines The foundation for this is the inter-
nationally recognized management standard OHSAS18001, which we 
have been using since 2010. During the reporting year, 73 German and 
international locations were audited according to OHSAS 18001 and 
ISO 14001. Their certification was renewed in all cases. With these 
results, we can guarantee a high health and safety standard in years to 
come.
All of the parties, tasks, and measures involved in the health and safety 
management system are described in a handbook titled Health & Safety 
Environment. The handbook was signed by our Board of Management 
as a symbol of our commitment to health and safety. Our health and 
safety measures are centrally steered at Group level, with health manag-
ers being responsible for implementation at the different locations. We 
systematically assess the effectiveness of our measures. This includes 
reviewing the results of our employee survey, evaluating stress preven-
tion measures under collective agreements, competitor analyses, and 
other relevant indicators. The analysis of this data forms the basis for 
annual measures that by far exceed legal requirements. Some examples 
of this are our comprehensive psychosocial counseling programs as 
well as our driver safety training and exercise offers.
One focus of our corporate health promotion activities is encouraging 
our employees to assume responsibility for their own health. In this vein, 
we expect our managers to foster a corresponding corporate culture. 
Our Group-wide employee survey in particular, which is conducted in 
30 countries, outlines a follow-up process which the managers go 
through together with their teams in 2-year cycles. Among other things, 
the employee survey determines the mental stress in the workplace, the 
available resources, and the consequences of stress on health. Health 
and safety management assists managers and teams when there are 
unsatisfactory results and provides recommendations for action 
together with offers based on the team results.
Different performance indicators reflect the effectiveness of our 
corporate health management activities: 
 
At Deutsche Telekom in Germany, the health rate (not counting 
people with long-term illnesses) in 2017 decreased slightly by 0.1 
to 93.7 percent but still remained high.
 
The total number of work-related accidents continued to decline in 
the reporting year in comparison with the previous year. The acci-
dent rate in Germany was 8.5 accidents (resulting in over three days 
of absence) per thousand employees, which continues to be well 
below the industry average.
 
The Group-wide health index – calculated as part of the 2017 
employee survey in 30 countries – increased positively by 0.1 to 3.6 
(on a scale of 1 to 5).
In 2017, we were once again distinguished for our health and safety 
management. Within the scope of the German Corporate Health Award 
(DeutscherUnternehmenspreis Gesundheit), we received the excellence 
seal for our holistic corporate health management and were awarded 
the special prize "Innovative Corporate Health Promotion " for our Active 
Workplace project. We also again received the Corporate Health Award, 
an initiative of the Handelsblatt publishing group, among others. We've 
been in first place in the Service, IT, and Communication category multi-
ple times. The jury, which consisted of experts in the fields of science, 
health, and occupational health and safety, especially honored the fact 
that health awareness is an important component of our corporate phi-
losophy.
FIT AND MOBILE AT WORK
We have been offering our employees special fitness programs at 
locations in Germany since 2014 to help counteract the effects of a day 
spent working at their desks. Qualified "mobile fitness coaches" teach 
easy-to-do exercises particularly for back and neck to small teams of 
employees. These programs are very popular among our employees.

By the end of 2017, we had given more than 1,000 courses within the 
framework of our comprehensive health promotion activities.
Recent scientific studies show that taking regular breaks is more effec-
tive than lengthy exercise sessions after work for people with desk jobs. 
We therefore added a new exercise offer in 2016 with the Active Work-
place project. This project gives our employees the opportunity to com-
bine their job with exercise with the help of so-called desk bikes. These 
stationary bikes help effectively prevent health risks associated with 
lack of movement at the office workstation.
About 4,000 employees were able to use a desk bike during its first 
implementation phase. This first phase was scientifically supported by 
a study conducted by BerufsgenossenschaftVerkehr (the occupational 
accident insurer of the transportation and telecommunication indus-
tries), the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German 
Social Accident Insurance (DGUV), and the German Sport University 
Cologne. The academics examined not only the test participants’ levels 
of acceptance and whether they felt good using the equipment, but also 
physiological activity parameters, energy conversion levels, and individ-
ual posture. Not only were participants having fun, their mental activity 
also increased. Another positive side effect was that participants 
burned more calories when cycling than when just sitting.
Because the positive response of our employees was supported by the 
accompanying study, we decided to order an additional 500 desk bikes 
in 2017. In the meantime, over 10,000 employees have taken advan-
tage of this program. We are planning to expand the program in 2018 
and include international locations as well.
PSYCHOSOCIAL COUNSELING AS PART OF CHANGE 
MANAGEMENT
All employees face major challenges when there are changes in the 
workplace. That is why psychosocial counseling for transformation pro-
cesses by the Employee and Executive Advisory Service plays an impor-
tant role at Deutsche Telekom. Our goal is to provide support to employ-
ees and managers and prevent psychological crises.
To this end, we offer individual counseling and consultation hours. 
Employees can take advantage of several one-hour counseling ses-
sions. Immediate phone counseling is also available through a special 
hotline ("TALK TIME"). We support managers and supervisors during 
change processes with appropriate tools. Talks and workshops on  
psychological health complete the offer. Targeted communication 
measures inform employees at affected locations of these offers.
In 2017 we especially supplemented the restructuring measures at 
DTSE (Deutsche Telekom Services Europe) by offering psychosocial 
counseling. We held special counseling days ("Employee and Executive 
Advisory Service on site") for greatly affected locations.
T-SYSTEMS: THE HAPPINESS PROJECT AND RESEARCH 
PROJECT ON MANAGERIAL HEALTH COMPETENC
Continuation of the Corporate Happiness project:
T-Systems started initiating changes in its corporate culture within the 
scope of a pilot project in 2016. The aim of the project is to apply the 
scientific findings of "positive psychology" to identify values that will 
enable all employees to better realize their potential. The project 
encourages them to independently work toward their own, as well as 
the company's, success. In 2016 we trained 27 "happiness ambassa-
dors" under the pilot project, offered training courses and impulse talks, 
and launched the Stop Complaining initiative. Due to the positive effect 
of the project, we decided in 2017 to expand it throughout the entire 
Group and train an additional 30 happiness ambassadors. We also car-
ried out numerous other activities at T-Systems during the reporting 
year. For example, we conducted various training sessions within the 
framework of the HR Academy (LINK to HR Academy, "Education and 
Development" subsection), held numerous impulse talks, and offered 
team building measures.
Research project on managerial health competence
Managers play a key role in promoting corporate health. That's because 
they not only influence their employees' workplace environment but also 
serve as an example. Numerous studies have proven a connection 
between managerial conduct and employee health. At the same time, 
managers themselves are an important target group for corporate 
health promotion measures, as they are frequently exposed to higher 
health hazards than employees without personnel responsibility.
Managers are hence the focus of the "HeLEvi" research project - 
the "Health opportunities – healthy self-management: recognizing, 
developing, and implementing potential" training program. T-Systems 
has paired up with the German Sport University Cologne and the local 
Cologne Institute for Health Economics and Clinical Epidemiology to 
carry out this project. The goal of the project is to design, implement, 
and evaluate an evidence-based training program for promoting health 
competence among managers. The project is being supported by the 
German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.
A total of 143 managers have participated in the HeLEvi program. The 
project ended in November 2017 with a closing event in Bonn, during 
which the professors presented the research partners with the project 
method and the study results. The next step will be to entrench the topic 
and increase corporate health promotion awareness within the Group.
STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF MANAGERS
Managers play an important role at the company when it comes to 
health promotion. In order to support Deutshe Telekom managers in 
their exemplary function, we already offer web-based training in addi-
tion to individual coaching. Topics include occupational health and 
safety, employee mental health, and corporate integration management 
after long-term illness. Health promotion is also a component of our cur-
rent management development programs. Our managers can choose 
from among a comprehensive portfolio of offers for supporting their 
managerial competence. One such example is the "HelEvi" project - 
the evidence-based development program for T-Systems managers.

DIGITALIZATION AND HEALTH – A JOINT PROJECT WITH HEALTH 
INSURER BARMER
In 2016, researchers at the University of St. Gallen commissioned by 
health insurer BARMER and Deutsche Telekom examined how digitali-
zation had changed the working world. The study showed positive 
aspects of digitalization, e.g. more flexible configuration of working 
hours and locations. Nevertheless, the results also pointed out risk  
factors with respect to physical and mental health. The study results  
are the basis for a corporate health management project that we started 
at the Group in May 2017 together with health insurer BARMER.
The aim of the project is to scientifically examine the effects of digitized 
workplaces as well as other use of digital technologies on employee 
health. With its "Digitalization and Health" pilot project, Deutsche  
Telekom is the first company to systematically tackle this range of topics 
together with a health insurer. The goal is to increase employee perfor-
mance and identify starting points for engaging in early prevention 
within the corporate context. The project connects science, HR man-
agement, employee representatives as well as health business units, 
thereby contributing to innovative human resources and health manage-
ment. Managers are the focus of this project. On the one hand, their 
managerial conduct is a decisive factor in the success of digitalization. 
On the other hand, they also bear a significant responsibility, for which 
they require support.
Initial measures were already tested at the end of 2017 – including 
M-Sence, an app for headache prevention, and Soma-Analytics, an  
app that provides personalized feedback on improving mental resil-
ience and productivity. Other pilot projects are planned for 2018. A digi-
tal guide will be created, among other things, which will help with the 
selection of the individually appropriate health promotion measures.
HEALTH AND SPORTS AT T-SYSTEMS MEXICO
Health Month
As part of our “Total Health” Program, an in-company training program 
was launched to promote physical exercise, improve the health and life-
style of employees, and enable them to participate in relaxing activities 
with their co-workers.
This year’s “Health Month” was organized in October 2017 and 
included activities for all our employees. The company received govern-
ment supportthrough the Mexican Social Security Institute and employ-
ees were offered a check-up with eye test, blood-pressure measure-
ments, testing for glucose levels, vaccinations for seasonal diseases, 
and height and weight checks.The program included six health presen-
tations, five guest specialists in insurance, dental and eye care, and four 
courses on civil defense. 371 employees took part in the Health Month 
representing 30 % of the workforce. They were able to attend any of the 
health events held in Puebla and Mexico City.
Sports Tournaments
T-Systems Mexico seeks to promote greater integration, better quality 
of life, and a good work-life balance. This year TSMX organized various 
sports tournaments such as volleyball, basketball, soccer, and dominos 
from January to December. There was a big uptake and approximately 
40 % of our employees took part in various activities. This helped to 
improve our work ethic,enhanced teamwork, contributed to a healthy 
lifestyle and released stress.
MEDICAL CHECK-UPS AT T-SYSTEMS IN RUSSIA
In 2017, all employees atT-Systems CIS & Rus were given an opportu-
nity tohave a preventive medical check-up throughout the year. It 
included checks by the specialists listedbelow (Neurologist, Ophthal-
mologist, Cardiologist, and others).
A total of 1074 employees attended the medical check-up in 2017.
305 employees were vaccinated in the fall of 2017 (voluntarily).
The doctor in the office is still available every Tuesday from11 a.m. until 
3.00 p.m. for a consultation. Between15 and 20 employees are given 
check-ups each week.

PREPARING OURSELVES FOR THE DIGITAL WORKING WORLD 
With a combined total of more than 6,600 apprentices and students on 
cooperative degree programs in the 2017/2018 training year, Deutsche 
Telekom is one of Germany's biggest training providers. In 2017 we 
provided 2,200 training positions throughout the Group, of which 1,300 
apprenticeships, 700 openings for Bachelor's students and 100 for 
Master's students. Up to 100 training positions were open to young 
refugees.
We promote lifelong learning and offer our employees a wide range 
of individual training and development opportunities, such as various 
programs for advancing expert or management careers.
The cornerstones of our vocational training and development programs 
are our our Employee Relations Policy, the Guiding Principles and the 
Leadership Principles.
Digital skills are the key to the future
We gear our training and continuing education offers to future-oriented 
strategic key areas such as big data, All IP and security. For example, 
our Cyber Security Professional program, which we started in 2014, 
started its fourth year during the reporting period. In March 2017, all 
participants in the program's first year successfully passed their final 
exams.
T-Systems created the Training & Skills Management (TSKM) depart-
ment in 2017. For example, TSKM supports the transformation of 
T-Systems, with 2,700 measures (as of November 2017), various skills 
management offers and an internal service agency with a special 
skills development portfolio. TSKM has an eye on technology trends 
such as artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud, analyzes possible 
training requirements and develops a suitable offering for T-Systems 
employees.
Digital learning is becoming standard
We have been promoting digital learning at our Group for many years. 
In 2017 more than 37 percent of all course hours were completed in 
digital form. We use innovative formats such as our Massive Open 
Online Courses (MOOCs) as well as simulations, concise learning mod-
ules for on the go and learning games. We also rely increasingly on self-
organized digital learning. For example, experts discuss future topics in 
Communities of Practice (CoPs). In 2017 there were 30 such CoPs 
working on strategic topics such as cyber security, clouds and Industry 
4.0 img.
The digital learning options are being gradually expanded, with 
T-Systems purchasing licenses for external online learning platforms 
since 2016. T-Systems employees can use these platforms to take 
advantage of various learning opportunities regardless of their location 
and according to their needs. In 2017 T-Systems added another pro-
vider to its portfolio, who provides digital learning offers specially for 
experts in the IT sector.

Strengthening managers
The portfolio for management development programs at Deutsche 
Telekom AG was completely redesigned in 2017. The contained pro-
grams focus on helping DT managers to master challenges and assist-
ing them with their management duties. In addition to an extensive train-
ing catalog, which supports managers in mastering their requirements, 
many new – primarily digital – programs were developed and carried 
out in 2017.
Proven tools for performance assessment
The Performance Dialog is the tool that we use to assess the perfor-
mance of top-level managers. Around 2,800 managers are evaluated 
with this tool. The assessment involves not only target achievement lev-
els but also looks at how the manager went about achieving these 
goals. Managers complete a self-assessment and obtain feedback from 
their colleagues who share the same hierarchy level.
We also continue to use our Compass tool to assess civil servants and 
employees covered by collective agreements in Germany and our Per-
formance & Potential Review for employees outside collective agree-
ments in Germany, a tool that is also used at many of our national com-
panies.
Reviewing effectiveness
We review the effectiveness of our training and development activities. 
These reviews involve standardized surveys conducted as part of our 
quality circle, which gives us a regular overview of the quality of our 
training and development activities via monthly reports. This allows us 
to continuously ensure the quality of the individual measures. Our Bolo-
gna@Telekom program designed to encourage part-time study, for 
example, is subject to extensive quality controls – from the application 
process to graduate management. We also use our regular employee 
survey to evaluate our training and continuing education offers and 
employ additional tools beyond our standard reports and surveys in 
special cases.
WE WANT TO BE A MAGNET FOR GLOBAL DIGITAL TALENT 
As a leading European ICT service provider, we need the best minds: 
creative thinkers and employees with a knack for technology that want 
to help us design the digital transformation. We look for top talent in 
all countries, which also contributes to the further internationalization 
of our Group. We offer applicants a worldwide platform for job searches 
and international standards in our selection process. To further 
strengthen our employer brand in the growing job markets, we 
developed a new global Employer Value Proposition (EVP) in 2017. 
This value proposition showcases what distinguishes us as an employer 
and helps us to achieve a consistent perception of our Group across all 
target groups.
We also use digital channels for recruiting. This includes our Global 
Online Challenge Platform, which we use to reach students, graduates, 
start-ups and IT professionals worldwide who enjoy mastering virtual 
business games. Our recruiting robot Roberta is our answer to "living 
digitalization". Roberta allows colleagues to participate in trade shows, 
events and trade congresses, personally answer questions on site and 
even provide people with live glimpses of Deutsche Telekom's working 
world - all while sitting at their office desk. Completely in line with our 
motto, "We shape the digital world to bring people closer together",  
we are shaping the digital world in order to bring people together and 
establish close relationships. Take the CMD+O project, which served to 
create an open workspace at the end of 2017 in Berlin for two weeks  
for students and young professionals. Those who were interested could 
take part in workshops and attend presentations. By employing these 
and other measures, we were able to acquire over 1,000 IT and tele-
communications experts in Germany alone in 2017.
We received several honors for our recruiting activities in 2017 as well. 
Our Find Your Team career website received the HR Excellence Award 
2017. The portal is helping us go down a new path between the classic 
career website and job search portal, where future colleagues and 
teams introduce themselves to each other. Every applicant thus has the 
opportunity to get to know the diversity of people, working methods, 
topics and tasks at our Group. We received the Innovation of the Year 
European HR Excellence Award for our recruiting robot Roberta. We 
also achieved second place for our social media activities in Germany  
in the overall ranking of market research institute Potentialpark. Further-
more, we were able to impress visitors to Europe's largest career trade 
fair for women, women&work, with our trade fair presence, which 
resulted in them once again selecting us as the most appealing 
employer.
We are particularly focused on increasing our attractiveness as an 
employer in new and growing markets. An example: Our Women's 
STEM Award, which we have been presenting since 2013 in collabora-
tion with "audimax" student magazine and the MINT-Zukunft-schaffen 
(Creating a STEM future) initiative, is now open to STEM students not 
only from Germany but also from other European countries. We will con-
tinue to promote the participation of women in STEM topics.
START UP!: OUR TRAINEE PROGRAM FOR YOUNG INNOVATORS 
Our Start up! trainee program helps young people start their career at 
Deutsche Telekom in Germany with a good skill set under their belt.  
The trainee program above all targets technology and IT graduates who 
have an entrepreneurial spirit and are open to new challenges. Since 
we also explicitly want to reach talent outside of Germany, we adapted 
our language requirements to those applicants in 2017. In the reporting 
period we accepted 32 university graduates into our trainee program, 
roughly 50 percent of whom were women. We want to increase the 
number of new trainees in the future.
During a period lasting 15 to 18 months, trainees familiarize themselves 
with different areas of the company in Germany and abroad. They take 
on challenging project assignments in various business areas. Experi-
enced mentors assist the trainees. The program is supplemented by 
innovative training formats and events. Our Start up! trainees also pur-
sue their own initiatives and support social projects within the context  
of our Social Days.
DEUTSCHE TELEKOM’S IN-HOUSE UNIVERSITY EDUCATES THE 
EXPERTS OF TOMORROW 
We educate experts for tomorrow's telecoms market at our University  
of Applied Sciences in Leipzig (HfTL). With 1,400 students in full-time, 
cooperative and part-time Bachelor's and Master's programs, HfTL is 
the only university in Germany to offer this special profile. When it 
EMPLOYEES 
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

comes to research, it focuses on ambitious topics that are relevant to 
society like conserving natural resources and advancing Germany's 
standing in the technology sector. Both research and academia are 
involved with innovative digitalization topics such as Industry 4.0 and 
smart cities. Digitalization plays an important role in supporting learning 
and teaching methods (blended learning) and in IT-assisted planning 
and administrative processes at HfTL.
Deutsche Telekom is currently examining the possibilities of further 
developing and aligning its university. One of these possibilities could 
be the creation of a foundation faculty for digital transformation at the 
adjacent Leipzig University of Applied Sciences (HTWK Leipzig). Initial 
evaluations show that combining the competencies of both academic 
institutions can lead to additional strong impulses for IT development in 
Leipzig and Saxony.
Data privacy certification program for Deutsche Telekom employees
Data privacy and data security are essential for acceptance and use 
of modern technologies. After successful implementation of an initial 
continuing education offer, Deutsche Telekom employees have been 
communicating detailed technical, legal and organizational knowledge 
in the area of data protection and data security since March 2018 within 
the scope of a certification program. The program qualifies participants 
for handling and managing demanding projects. We also want to offer 
participants with the right qualifications the opportunity to complete the 
certification program with a Master's degree.
Position paper on artificial intelligence
Use of artificial intelligence (AI) is an important driver of digital transfor-
mation and is very rapidly gaining in importance at companies, govern-
ment agencies and in our daily lives. Not many people are aware that 
AI is used in Internet searches, in online shops and for voice-controlled 
assistants. In 2017 the industry association Bitkom published a position 
paper titled "AI-Assisted Decision-Making", which explained the impor-
tance of algorithms in the digitalization of business models nowadays. 
The position paper was authored by a large team of business and 
science experts, including experts from HfTL. It is the basis for the 
discussion of the social, economic and ethical prerequisites for making 
AI a success in digitalization.
Students are given insights into research and development activities
A key element in our study programs at HfTL is to actively involve stu-
dents in research and development projects. Some important projects 
in 2017 were the following:
 
Prototype of a digital organ donor card developedIn the past, there 
was no digital solution for documenting a person's decision to be or 
not be an organ donor. A team of students has now developed a 
prototype of a digital organ donor card. The card holder’s personal 
decision can be saved in a database using an app. The app is easy 
to use and features a strict data security concept. What's more, the 
app features a comprehensive FAQ section, articles that clear up 
common prejudices about organ donation and other helpful infor-
mation. A fun quiz tests users' knowledge about organ donation. 
The students will present the prototype to the Federal Centre for 
Health Education (BZgA) in 2018.
 
Intelligent lighting in carsIn recent years, HfTL students teamed up 
with the Institute of Textile Technology at RWTH Aachen University 
and the Dormagen-based company Perlon-Nextrusion GmbH to 
develop an environmentally friendly and energy-efficient manufac-
turing process for optical polymer fibers. This process cannot only 
be used in data communication, but also for intelligent lighting  
concepts in the car, especially for surface lighting of roof liners.
 
Optical technologies for fifth generation (5G) mobile communica-
tions, the next mobile communications generation, will use many 
different technologies, including optical transmission. In this con-
text, HfLT is carrying out multiple research activities with student 
involvement. For example, the properties of LED are being investi-
gated and a model is being developed that will predict the extent  
to which LED is suitable for data communication. The research  
activities have been integrated into the international standardization 
activities of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engi-
neers). They are slated to be further developed within the European 
context.
 
Another project, being conducted together with the Telekom  
Innovation Laboratories in Berlin, is comparing and assessing the 
performance of free-space optical communication and 60-GHz  
technology under various weather conditions.
PROMOTING THE DIVERSITY OF OUR YOUNG TALENT 
We stand for open-mindedness and are committed to diversity also 
among our young talents. To this end, we pay attention to the most var-
ied of performance levels and needs:
 
Depending on how long their families have been in Germany and 
where they come from, young people with migrant backgrounds 
often encounter particular problems on the job and vocational train-
ing market. We see encouraging them as an opportunity and are 
careful to guarantee a non-discriminatory selection process. As of 
December 31, 2017, 10.3 percent of our apprentices and students 
in cooperative degree programs in Germany have a nationality other 
than German, representing a total of 68 other countries.
 
In 2009 we launched the "My chance to get going" entry-level train-
ing scheme in collaboration with the German Federal Employment 
Agency. The project prepares disadvantaged young people with 
very little chances on the vocational training market for an appren-
ticeship at Deutsche Telekom. Results so far have been good.  
A total of 460 out of 664 interns from 2009 through 2016 started a 
vocational training program with us; 110 were accepted into the first 
year of the program and 350 directly into the second year. Another 
approx. 20 interns started the program in 2017.
 
Since 2011 we have been collaborating with the German Federal 
Employment Agency to offer single parents the opportunity to com-
plete a training program or cooperative degree program part-time. 
22 young people began their part-time training with this program in 
2017.

 
To encourage diversity in the program, we also work to increase the 
number of women participating in technical cooperative study pro-
grams. While in 2010 the share of women was only 11 percent in 
Germany, it has meanwhile risen to 17.6 percent.
 
Around 1.2 percent of our apprentices in Germany are young peo-
ple with disabilities. This is above-average in view of the total num-
ber of disabled people in Germany.
We offer in our refugee initiative in Germany up to 100 training posi-
tions, entry-level training schemes and cooperative Bachelor's and  
Master's programs. In our recruiting efforts, we rely on our long-term 
successful cooperation with the Federal Employment Agency, social 
media communication and dedicated volunteers. We want to optimally 
support the refugees to help them integrate into regular educational 
structures. They receive support from their trainers or coaches and also 
have the opportunity to attend additional, job-related language courses. 
The training staff receive assistance from an external service provider to 
make sure that the needs of this target group are met. The refugees  
also have access to counseling and supportive services as needed.
PROMOTING DIGITAL COMPETENCE IN TRAINING 
We want to enable our young talent to competently use digital tools 
such as e-learning systems, communicate online in a professional  
manner, research and properly process information for a specific target 
group and share their knowledge and experiences with others. It is also 
important for them to critically assess their own media use and know 
which online information is reliable.
Digital learning: flexible and individual
To make learning more location- and time-independent, we equip our 
apprentices with modern laptops, smartphones and access to our 
Group's internal social network YAM. We are continuously expanding 
our digital formats when communicating career- and study-specific 
expertise. Additionally, our apprentices use the TelTec learning plat-
form, with which they can independently plan, document and balance 
the learning process. The platform also offers a digital learning blog, 
which can be used as a learning aid and also as preparation for the 
introduction of a new digital learning portfolio in 2018. The new portfo-
lio will do even more to help the apprentices plan, document and reflect 
on their learning phases.
ADVANCED TRAINING TO BECOME A CYBER SECURITY PRO-
FESSIONAL: SUCCESSFUL TRAINING OF FIRST COMPANY-OWN 
HACKERS 
Our training courses for cyber security professionals (certified by the 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry) are important continuing educa-
tion offers in Germany. Data protection experts are rare in today's labor 
market – which is why we started the part-time training program in 2014 
that bridges this gap. In 2017 all of the participants of the first year of 
the program successfully completed their training and passed their 
exams at the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce. All of the 
graduates were given positions at various Telekom Security units.
Deutsche Telekom apprentices and students in cooperative study 
programs can apply for the two-and-a-half-year part-time course after 
completion of their vocational training or course of study. If they are 
accepted, the program is integrated into their regular tasks and supple-
mented by topic-based and general modules in a variety of formats 
(classroom courses, e-learning, blended learning). Those who complete 
the development program receive a certificate for IT security profession-
als from the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The fourth year of the program started in September 2017 with 12 par-
ticipants. In 2016 we won third place with our innovative continuing 
education concept in the "Large Enterprise" category at the Education 
Awards hosted by the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(DIHK).
COMPETENCE MANAGEMENT: PREPARED FOR THE  
CHALLENGES OF TOMORROW 
To remain competitive in the future, we are gearing our continuing  
education programs, skills-building measures and recruitment practice 
to the skills that will be needed in the future.
T-Systems HR Academy continued
Our HR experts also need regular continuing education to help them 
stay on top of the latest technological trends and future skills require-
ments. The T-Systems HR Academy focuses on the requirements of 
the digital future. To date, more than 1,300 experts have taken part in 
59 workshops. The focus was on methods, tools and topics such as 
corporate happiness and collaboration. The feedback on these offers 
was very positive.
T-Systems: transparent processes for requirements planning
The pace of technological development is becoming increasingly faster. 
Correspondingly, the requirements regarding employee skills are also 
changing. In order to survive in a highly competitive environment, 
employers must be precise in planning requirements and resources  
and ensure that the right skills are available at the right time in the right 
place. Companies need clarity about the required skills so as to offer 
the corresponding training opportunities.
One thing is clear, however: conventional resource management is 
nearing its limit. That is why T-Systems launched the Dynamic Capacity 
Management (DCM) project in 2017. The goal is to create worldwide 
transparency about existing and necessary skills, identify possible gaps 
and derive specific action areas and measures, such as strategic skills 
development and recruiting activities. Such transparency is an essential 
prerequisite for targeted staffing of future deals and projects. After the 
project content and project managers were identified and the respec-
tive departments committed to the project in April 2017, the project was 
officially launched in May 2017. DCM processes will be based on an IT 
tool that is already established at the company. Following successfully 
concluded talks with the employee representatives, a pilot phase will 
start at the beginning of 2018. Over 200 employees with various job 
profiles, such as project managers and IT architects, will test the newly 
designed processes. The focus will be on testing the functionality of the 
IT applications and the efficiency of the new roles and processes. With 
DCM we offer our employees increased transparency about the skills 
we are looking for and the possibility of channeling their own develop-
ment accordingly.

Telekom Deutschland: Planning the job profiles of the future
Competence management also plays an important role at Telekom 
Deutschland. Skills needed by employees in the future are identified 
early on. HR and the respective departments, such as Sales, Service 
and Technology, work together closely on this. They jointly identify 
strategic focal topics, develop future job profiles and determine the 
skills and hiring needs through the year 2020. Measures are then 
defined to close any gaps in terms of skills, hiring and training. The pilot 
project started in 2015 at Technology with the "speed boat technology". 
The second step was to develop a skills database and test it in a pilot 
project involving specific departments in 2017. Here skill deficits are 
being determined in detail, training measures devised and other asser-
tions made regarding retraining and recruitment. Further pilot expan-
sions and negotiations with the employee representatives for a Group-
wide rollout will follow in 2018.
FUTURE WORK – WORKING IN THE DIGITAL AGE 
We support mobile working models and give our employees the free-
dom to shape their working environment. The working environment of 
the future – Future Work – is based on four modules: open-plan offices, 
desk-sharing, mobile working and a new type of collaboration. We pro-
vide the corresponding IT solutions. Since the launch of the Future 
Work concept in 2014 in Germany, we have equipped Group headquar-
ters in Bonn and the Hamburg and Frankfurt locations with open office 
areas, the option of desk sharing, networking rooms as well as project 
and creativity rooms. We continued down this path in 2017. The focuses 
were:
Virtual and self-organized cooperation 
More and more, our employees are no longer working in inflexible, 
closed project teams but rather are developing cross-functional and 
cross-hierarchical solutions. This also helps them expand their knowl-
edge and better see the big picture.
In 2017, for example, there were 30 Communities of Practice (CoPs) 
at T-Systems working on strategic topics such as cyber security, clouds 
and Industry 4.0 – less than in the previous year (40). The reason for this 
was a concentration and bundling of the CoP topics. A guideline intro-
duced in 2017 and a platform for sharing best practices are helping to 
continuously improve this form of cooperation.
The T-Systems' HR Academy focused, among other things, on the topics 
of digital collaboration and new working methods in 2017. One high-
light of the year was the Virtual HR Convention. About 400 employees 
from 21 countries took part in 14 virtual workshops and presentations. 
In this context, we handed out seven HR Awards to teams who worked 
together particularly successfully. The most important ideas stemming 
from the workshops – on topics such as attitude, strengths and a posi-
tive culture of dealing with mistakes – will be further elaborated and 
implemented after the convention.
Agile project work – effective and success
Customer projects are becoming more complex and dynamic. That's 
why instead of using classic project planning, we rely on agile working 
methods, so that we can be flexible in responding to customer require-
ments. Simple methods, combined with the right agile tools, ensure 
communication, effective teamwork and a coordinated approach in the 
team. In 2017 we launched the GSI Goes Agile program to consolidate 
the many agile initiatives within Global Systems Integration at T-Sys-
tems, some of which were established years ago. Our Agile University 
offers employees training and certifications on agile methods and roles, 
such as Scrum Master, as well as design thinking. About 1,000 employ-
ees have taken part so far.
Of course, we need the right framework conditions in order to make 
agile working successful. That is why in 2017 T-Systems became a part-
ner of the diGAP (Good Agile Project Work in the Digitalized World) 
research project sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Education and 
Research. This project is investigating agile working in order to derive 
recommended actions for designing the working environment and the 
cooperation of agile teams. Agile project methods have been on the 
agenda of T-Systems' Global Systems Integration (GSI) department for 
quite some time now. That's why a preliminary study on diGAP entailed 
a survey of GSI employees, asking about their experiences. In Septem-
ber 2017, the results of the survey were presented to the diGAP project, 
where they will serve as the foundation for further data collection and 
measures. The research project will run for a term of three years.
ENCOURAGING AND RETAINING TALENT 
Dedicated, technology-minded and service-oriented employees are 
pivotal to the success of our business. The aim of our global talent 
management is to identify such employees at the company, support 
and involve them, give them opportunities for further development and 
ultimately retain them.
Global Talent Pool: A new Group-wide process simplifies staffing
Employees planning their next career step or who want to amass experi-
ence in projects can join the Global Talent Pool. With more than 850 
employee profiles, some 25 percent of which were posted by women 
and 56 percent by international colleagues, almost two-thirds more 
employees introduced themselves on the new platform compared to 
the predecessor platform during the reporting year. The share of female 
colleagues (27 percent in 2016) remained about the same, while the 
number of international employees on the platform rose significantly 
(41 percent in 2016). The platform is a useful tool for increasing talent 
visibility and simplifying staffing processes throughout the Group. HR 
experts are able to peruse the profiles employees post to the platform 
and contact suitable candidates. The Global Talent Pool also encour-
ages employees to gain experience at different business units or 
national companies and in a range of functions, furthering diversity 
at the Group.
Talent conferences offer opportunities to engage in dialog
In September 2017, around 350 employees from about 20 countries 
attended two conferences. One of these conferences took place simul-
taneously in Bonn and Athens, linked by live streaming. Participants 
had the opportunity to learn more about effective strategies to help 
them advance their careers in the age of increasing competition by 
AI and robotics. The event also offered an opportunity to network with 
around 65 of the Group's top-level managers, who made guest appear-
ances at the event.

MANAGER PERFORMANCE REVIEWS REVISED BASED ON PER-
FORMANCE DIALOG 
The Performance Dialog, introduced in 2014, is a Group-wide, system-
atic process for the assessment and development of our managers. It 
takes place once per year and is based on continuous feedback. How-
ever, the manager's leadership behavior is not only evaluated by his/her 
direct supervisor but by his/her colleagues on the same hierarchy level 
as well. The goal is to assess the manager's potential and continuously 
improve individual performance. In 2017 we restructured the Perfor-
mance Dialog and simplified the process. We now focus on the manag-
er's individual development and strengthening the feedback culture. 
The new performance management process is modular in design so 
that preferences and situational circumstances can be taken into 
account.
This performance assessment continues to be based on our Guiding 
Principles and our Leadership Principles of "Collaborate," "Innovate" 
and "Empower to Perform."
Our Compass tool for assessing employees covered by collective agree-
ments and civil servants in Germany and our international Performance 
& Potential Review continue to be used throughout the Group.
MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS EXPANDED
Our new levelUP! program prepares executives at Deutsche Telekom 
to handle the topics of tomorrow in just ten months. The model of the 
ambidextrous organization sets the focus on strengthening a culture  
of innovation and technology-based management within the initiative.  
A mixture of digital and on-site formats enables managers to shape their 
learning flexibly and individually and define their own learning path-
ways. 700 managers at Deutsche Telekom took part in levelUP! in 2017; 
another class is planned for 2018.
leadFirst is a completely digital, virtual management transition program 
that is intended for managers who have recently assumed a manage-
ment position at DT International. Its aim is to convey their new roles 
to the managers clearly and comprehensively and to create a solid 
management foundation in harmony with the leadership principles at 
Deutsche Telekom AG.
During the program, the participants reflect on their own ideas regard-
ing leadership. This global, digital program not only helps to develop 
leadership skills at the highest level, but also promotes virtual leader-
ship skills and offers numerous opportunities for networking.
We also offer a wide range of challenging training courses for future 
leaders in our German-language management development program 
(Führungskräfte-Entwicklungsprogramm, FEP) and our English-lan-
guage Leadership Development Program (LDP). Both programs 
prepare participants for their first or more challenging management 
positions. With these steps, we also aim to implement a shared vision  
of leadership within Deutsche Telekom AG.
YOUTH IN T-SYSTEMS SOUTH AFRICA
T-Systems South Africa established an internal Internship Program 
in 2006, to assist graduates with work experience. The Internship Pro-
gram, registered with MICT Seta, is a one-year structured program 
comprising 95 % practical training with the balance being compli-
mented by mentoring, life skills, and technical training.
Every year, the program offers interns an opportunity to get international 
exposure through a 5 to 6-week International Exchange Program. To 
date, over 700 interns have participated in the program, with a place-
ment rate of 75%. However, 2015 boasted a 96% placement rate, of 
which 80% are employed within T Systems.
Not only do the interns receive valuable practical experience, they also 
receive soft skills training in the following areas: Twelve modules are 
covered during the internship contract period: World of Work, Commu-
nications, Customer Service, Self Awareness & Personal Branding,  
Conflict & Diversity Management, Personal Finances, Presentations & 
Assertiveness, Business Writing and Job Readiness.

tation skills, coaching on setting up a career/development plan, and 
support for achieving their goals. We have received very positive feed-
back from our staff about this opportunity.
EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT AT HRVATSKI TELEKOM
Our professional education program “HT Academy” and unlimited 
availability of digital learning platforms enable all our employees to 
participate in a rolling program of skill enhancement.
Talent Development
In 2016, we launched our new talent management program “Top Talent” 
with the aim of retaining and motivating our key people, and high-poten-
tial staff. Manager nomination and assessment center results were used 
to identify 105 talented high-flyers with expert or leadership career 
potential out of larger pool of employees. The high-flyers participated 
in targeted development activities over a period of 1.5 years. In 2017, 
the talent program for the first generation of talents was successfully 
completed. By the end of 2017, 30 % of these top talents had been 
promoted to a more complex or a managerial role at Hrvatski Telekom.
Leadership Development
From 2016, all managers in B-1positions have been involved in a tailor-
made leadership program. The program started with assessment center 
as a quality baseline for identifying skill gaps and continued with seven 
targeted two-day workshops consisting of a range of self-help activities 
for attendees. The program came to an end in November 2017and the 
majority of attendees evaluated it as an exceptional opportunity for 
development of personal skills, experience sharing, and networking.
In 2017, a dedicated development program was set up for mid-level 
managers concentrated on typical challenges for this target group. 
The program was launched in Q4 2017.

Diversity and equal opportunity are essential not only for a stable soci-
ety but for a company as well. People from approximately 150 countries, 
women and men, young and old as well as people with different abilities 
and cultural backgrounds, work together effectively at Deutsche 
Telekom. This diversity helps us come up with the best ideas and 
products in global competition.

SUPPORTING DIVERSITY 
Our aim is to promote and benefit from the diversity of our employees 
as a source of creativity and innovation. That is why we offer our employ-
ees numerous opportunities to grow personally and professionally, 
regardless of their gender, age, sexual preference, health situation, 
ethnic background, religion, or culture.
Our Group-wide Diversity Policy, Guiding Principles, and Employee 
Relations Policy as well as our "Code of Human Rights & Social Princi-
ples" form the foundation of our commitment. We are also a founding 
member of the Diversity Charter association.
Equal opportunity is a particularly important issue for us - one for which 
we have been fighting for more than two decades. Our goal is to 
increase the number of women in expert and managerial positions: 
We want to fill 30 percent of leadership positions in middle and upper 
management worldwide with women. To this end, we launched the Fair 
Share initiative. On December 31, 2017, the percentage of women in 
middle and upper management was xx percent (previous year: 25.4 
percent); the share of women in our Group’s Supervisory Board was 
45 percent (previous year: 40 percent).
Our commitment to integrating refugees into the labor market also 
promotes diversity within our company. We offer entry opportunities by 
means of internship, training, the "Internship PLUS Direct Entry" pilot 
project, or direct entry into an expert or managerial position.
As early as during the hiring process we emphasize diversity and 
consider options other than just traditional educational routes. Good 
examples of this are our entry-level training scheme for young people 
who are disadvantaged in terms of their social and educational back-
ground and our part-time apprenticeships/degree programs for single 
parents.
We support an effective work-life balance with an extensive work-life 
portfolio to allow our employees to realize their abilities in the best pos-
sible way. This includes daycare offers and assistance with caring for 
family members; these offers exceed legal requirements. Examples 
include different options for reducing working hours, the lifetime work 
account, and guaranteed return to full-time work. As of  December 31, 
2017, 13.6 percent of employees covered by collective agreements and 
20.4 percent of Deutsche Telekom civil servants throughout Germany 
were currently working part-time. The number of disabled employees 
working for us in Germany puts us well over the statutory quota of 
5 percent.
We offer multiplier and mentor programs to establish managers as 
role models and ambassadors who encourage diversity. Many of our 
employees have become actively involved in addressing various 
aspects of diversity, for example as members of internal initiatives 
such as queerbeet, a network of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transsexual 
employees, or of the numerous women's networks that have been estab-
lished within the Group. In 2015 we initiated a Group-wide campaign 
on unconscious bias, which we continued in 2017. Since then we have 
been increasing appreciation for diversity within the Group through 
explanatory videos and digital workshops.
We regularly assess the effectiveness of our measures for encouraging 
diversity and internally publish the findings on platforms such as Fair 
Share and the Deutsche Telekom work-life report. We complied with the 
new legal requirements stipulated by the Act to Promote Transparency 
of Pay Structures with a separate remuneration report as an annex to 
the 2017 management report.
At the start of 2018, the T-Share was included in the global and cross-
sectoral Bloomberg Financial Services Gender-Equality Index (BFGEI). 
Bloomberg is a U.S. information service provider that primarily provides 
financial data. The Index acknowledges a total of 104 companies that 
promote gender equality at work. At the same time, the Index provides 
investors and organizations with aggregated, standardized data about 
the percentage of women and men employees at companies and about 
specific offers for employees, social commitment to equal opportunity 
as well as the product and vendor structure. The analyzed data refer to 
the 2016 financial year.

FIFTH GERMAN DIVERSITY DAY: MANAGERS DISCUSS 
DIVERSITY AT WORK
The Diversity Charter is an independent economic initiative that boasts 
the participation of 2,600 companies and institutions in Germany. 
The Charter's goal is to create a work environment free of prejudice. 
All employees deserve respect and appreciation – regardless of gender, 
nationality, ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age, sexual orienta-
tion and identity. Deutsche Telekom is a founding member of the initia-
tive. As in past years, we participated in the fifth nationwide German 
Diversity Day in 2017. Together with 120 managers from partner compa-
nies from the Rhine-Ruhr network, we exchanged information during a 
meeting on topics such as "Working World 2030," "Unconscious Bias," 
"Cultural Skills," and "Flexible Working Hours" and discussed the inter-
ests of the LGBTI (= Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersexed) 
community.
ACTION PLAN FOR INCLUSION YIELDS INITIAL SUCCESS
In 2017, more than 7 percent of Deutsche Telekom employees Group-
wide were either disabled or have equivalent status. This number was 
higher than average compared to other private and public-sector 
employers and thus remained at a high level. In 2016 we introduced 
the "Living Diversity – Inclusion@DT" action plan. This plan helps imple-
ment the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and 
yielded initial success in 2017. Deutsche Telekom's good examples 
were honored with the first-time-ever bestowing of the Inclusion Award. 
As of September 2017, the town hall meetings and the HR Business 
Talk are being translated by sign language interpreters and transmitted 
live throughout the company on an additional channel.
CAREER WITH CHILDREN PROGRAM STARTED FOR A THIRD 
TIME
Our Career with Children mentoring program started up again in April 
2017. Potential junior employees for technical and managerial positions 
from various Group business units in Germany are coached before, 
during, and after their parental leave by an experienced manager in 
their role as mentor. They amass new technical and methodological 
competencies "in tandem" and benefit from participating in the pro-
gram's network. The third round of the Career with Children program 
saw the training of 31 tandems. The program was also supplemented 
by web-based learning modules on various topics. More than 90 per-
cent of participating junior employees and two-thirds of the managers 
are female. The program lasts 22 months and ends in January 2019.
TRAINING PROGRAM PREPARES EMPLOYEES FOR THE 
SUPERVISORY BOARD
In 2014 we became the first DAX company to develop a training 
program to prepare employees for supervisory board positions. The 
program was developed in collaboration with the European School of 
Management and Technology (ESMT) . We are particularly interested in 
encouraging women to take on supervisory board positions. In addition 
to information on the traditional activities of supervisory board mem-
bers, the training also gives insight into practical experiences presented 
by supervisory board members, case studies from the Group, and a 
simulated supervisory board meeting. So far we have trained a total of 
64 potential supervisory board members, around half of whom work at 
business units outside of Germany. Ten women who have completed 
the program were appointed to a Deutsche Telekom supervisory board.
A more extensive workshop for former program participants took place 
in Berlin in October 2017. They were trained in various subjects such as 
corporate governance, cyber security, and startup investments as well 
as ethical matters.
COMMITMENT TO INCREASING THE NUMBER OF WOMEN 
IN MANAGERIAL POSITIONS
Our goal is to have women occupy at least 30 percent of positions in 
middle and upper management. To this end, we have initiated numer-
ous measures: expansion of our work-life balance offer by means of 
parental leave models, flexible working hours, and childcare programs, 
a mentoring program for supervisory board candidates, targeted recruit-
ing of female talent, for example through the Talents@Telekom talent 
platform, and the "Fair Share" initiative started in 2010.
This allowed us to continuously increase the share of women in man-
agement positions – from 19 percent in 2010 to 25.4 percent on 
December 31, 2017. With 45 percent on the Group's Supervisory 
Board, we have already surpassed our own goal as well as the statutory 
gender quota introduced in Germany on January 1, 2016. Our quota for 
women, which we want to achieve by the end of 2020, also applies to 
the two levels beneath Board of Management level, the management 
of the national companies, and the internal supervisory boards in 
Germany. With these efforts, we are significantly surpassing the 
statutory regulations in effect in Germany since 2015.
SPONSORSHIP OF “EVERY WOMAN IN TECHNOLOGY” 
AWARDS IN GREAT BRITAIN
T-Systems Limited partnered with Everywoman in 2013 and is now an 
active member of the network. Everywoman is a membership organiza-
tion that has championed the advancement of women in business since 
its foundation in 1999. It works alongside companies looking to develop 
and retain a pipeline of female leaders who want to advance themselves 
and others.
In 2017, we rebranded our own Everywoman community – which is now 
known as Diversi-T. It has a broader focus on ensuring that T-Systems is 
a truly inclusive environment where all diversity issupported and cham-
pioned. The aim of the network is to help staff connect and stay inspired 
by providing the opportunity to network internally and externally. There 
are also opportunities to attend in-company webinars, bi-monthly meet-
ings and an annual event to hear and learn from each other and from 
other tech companies leading in diversity.
As part of our commitment toDiversi-T, the Board and all people manag-
ers received training in unconscious biasand how this can affect recruit-
ment, personal development and other core processes. The most posi-
tive outcome of this training was to allow the conversation on diversity 
and bias to becomemore open.
While our Everywoman Program has evolved into Diversi-T, we are still 
very committed to helping to close the gender gap in the ICT industry 
and attend the “Everywoman in Technology” awards each year taking 
some of our customers with us to help build our brand and maintain a 
broad client relationship. The awards play a vital part in highlighting role 
models whose stories and achievements demonstrate to those young 
women and girls that they too can achieve great success if they opt to 
forge a career in IT. With this in mind, T-Systems sponsors the “rising

There are still places in the world where human rights are not a 
respected. We may be exposed to country- and supplier-specific risks 
through our global procurement activities; these include, for instance, 
the use of child labor or poor local labor and safety conditions. Compli-
ance with human rights is very important to our Group. This applies 
both internally within our company and to our business partners and 
suppliers as well. To also ensure compliance with human rights outside 
of our Group, we expressly require our over 30,000 suppliers in more 
than 80 countries to assume this responsibility as well.

MANAGING SUSTAINABILITY IN PROCUREMENT PROCESSES 
We have been working to improve sustainability throughout our sup-
ply chain for many years. We have laid the foundation for this with 
our sustainable procurement strategy: We adhere to principles for 
socially and environmentally friendly procurement throughout the 
Group and manage our processes with the help of internal and 
external performance indicators and management tools.
Our sustainability criteria therefore apply to the entire procurement 
process, i.e. from the initial request to contract signing.
Fundamental norms and standards
We have defined minimum social and environmental standards for our 
corporate governance through our Guiding Principles and voluntary 
commitments. We also require our suppliers to comply with these stand-
ards. To this end, we use our Supplier Code of Conduct, which is an 
integral component of our suppler contracts. This Code of Conduct 
makes reference to the following Group policies:
 
Our Group-wide Code of Conduct and
 
The document "Code of Human Rights & Social Principles" 
(previously: Social Charter img)
In November 2017 we underscored our commitment to human rights 
and developed our Social Charter further into the "Code of Human 
Rights & Social Principles".
The following guidelines are also binding for our suppliers:
 
The Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy
 
The Fraud Policy
 
The Statement on Extractives
 
The List of banned substances
With our Supplier Code of Conduct we have made a commitment to 
complying with the fundamental principles and standards set forth by 
the International Labour Organization and the Organisation for Eco-
nomic Co-operation and Development as well as with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Global Compact. We regularly 
check compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct among our 
strategic suppliers.

Entrenchment in the company
Our sustainable procurement strategy is based on our CR strategy and 
has been effectively incorporated into our procurement processes.  
The Sustainable Procurement Working Group (SPWG img) ensures 
Group-wide implementation. The members of the SPWG are available  
to assist all our employees in all sustainability-related procurement  
matters. The heads of the CR and Procurement departments are jointly 
responsible for the implementation of sustainable procurement prac-
tices. They report directly to the Board of Management member for 
Human Resources and Finance, respectively. Our Chief Human 
Resources Officer is responsible for supply chain management as well 
as for implementing the Global Compact [Info icon] principles regarding 
human rights and work standards. An established escalation process 
calls for decisions to be made at Board of Management level in serious 
cases.
We have also specified sustainable procurement requirements for the 
BuyIn Joint Venture between Deutsche Telekom and Orange. To this 
end, both companies created a joint supplier code. The code describes 
the high ethical, social, ecological, and human rights expectations and 
requirements for our suppliers.
We have incorporated our sustainability principles into the Group's 
Global Procurement Policy to provide orientation for our Procurement 
employees. The procurement practices set forth in the policy provide 
specific guidelines for rocurement in Germany and serve as recommen-
dations for our national companies. An e-learning tool is available to our 
employees throughout the Group for training purposes. This learning 
offer is available to our buyers and all other interested employees. It 
describes how sustainability principles should be implemented in day-
to-day business, among other things. Our new buyer handbook provides 
an overview of which CR criteria need to be taken into account during 
which part of the procurement process.
KPI to promote sustainability
We measure and manage our sustainability performance in our procure-
ment activities with the "Sustainable Procurement" ESG KPI. This KPI 
measures the ratio between the procurement volume we receive from 
suppliers whose compliance with social and environmental criteria has 
been verified through self-assessments, E-TASC img, or social audits, 
and our total procurement volume. We accomplished our goal of cover-
ing 80 percent by 2020 as early as 2016. We want to maintain this tar-
get until 2020. What's more, we have established two other ESG KPIs 
for managing our procurement activities. On the one hand, we want to 
increase the order volume that is covered by the CDP Supply Chain Pro-
gram. On the other hand, we want to increase the share of CR-classified 
suppliers among our TOP 200 suppliers. Qualification tools include self-
assessments, audits, sustainability workshops for suppliers, and sup-
plier development programs. In the future, we will be focusing even 
more on monitoring risky material groups/suppliers with the help of suit-
able management tools.
Scores in sustainability rankings
Every year leading rating agencies measure the sustainability per-
formance of large enterprises. Deutsche Telekom scored 72 out of  
100 points in the supply chain management category of the 2017  
RobecoSAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment. Although we were 
unable to repeat our excellent performance of last year (98 points) due 
to new issues and a changed evaluation method, we remain one of the 
leading companies in the ICT sector. We are continuously working on 
improvements in our supply chain, thereby securing our leading posi-
tion and expanding it.
MANY PLAYERS, ONE GOAL: FORUM ON SUSTAINABILITY  
IN SUPPLY CHAINS
In January 2017 the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) organized a dialog 
event in Xi’an, China. About 130 representatives from ICT companies, 
international NGOs, CR organizations, auditing firms as well as the 
world of science discussed how to promote the development of a more 
sustainable supply chain for ICT products. They especially focused on 
the supply chain aspects of working hours/wages, health and safety,  
the environment, and ethics. JAC is an alliance of currently 17 telecom-
munications providers; Deutsche Telekom is a founding member.
Among other things, the following results were achieved at the event:
 
JAC member companies and suppliers should commit to going 
beyond merely fulfilling minimum requirements in order to empower 
management and employees on site to drive improvements.
 
Cooperation between the JAC, suppliers, and local authorities offers 
opportunities to train employees and management in regard to real-
istic and understandable sustainability goals.
 
During audits, more focus should be placed on aspects such as 
social dialogue with stakeholders.
SUSTAINABILITY IN PROCUREMENT ONLINE TRAINING
In 2017 we revised and updated the Sustainability in Procurement 
e-learning tool. A short video summarizes the most important informa-
tion and measures in Procurement with regard to sustainability.
And it's not only our own employees whom we train on the topic of  
sustainability. Our business partners and suppliers also receive training 
within the scope of our supplier development program.

We maintain business relationships with more than 30,000 suppliers in 
over 80 countries. Our relationships with suppliers are based on trust 
and dialog combined with monitoring and providing concrete support 
for the implementation of sustainability standards. We have a variety of 
tools, methods, and measures in place to help us improve the sustaina-
bility of our supply chain. Our basic aim is to recognize the cause of any 
problems and to work closely together with our suppliers to resolve 
them.

IMPROVING SUSTAINABILITY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN
Depending on the development phase of the supplier relationship, we 
use different tools to make our supply chain more sustainable. When 
selecting a new supplier, the topic of sustainability is included in the 
decision-making process with an importance of 10 percent. This 
creates strong incentives for suppliers to make their business more 
sustainable and to offer more sustainable products and services.
We also use a four-level approach to minimize risks and encourage our 
suppliers to improve their practices. The funnel chart illustrates the pro-
cess. In the first step, the pre-qualification, we obligate all of our suppli-
ers to acknowledge our Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC), which 
places strict ethical, social, ecological, and human rights requirements 
on our suppliers. We conduct a risk analysis to identify suppliers with a 
particularly high risk with regard to these aspects. We require strategi-
cally relevant or high-risk suppliers to provide us with comprehensive 
self-disclosures. They can provide this information to us using the 
E-TASC (Electronics-Tool for Accountable Supply Chains powered by 
EcoVadis) system. Our experts then assess the self-disclosures as well 
as additional background information. We take things a step further in 
our relationships to certain suppliers that exhibit a higher CR risk and 
conduct on-site audits (2017 audit results) (step 2).
In 2017 we conducted 89 on-site assessments (audits) on direct and 
indirect suppliers. We let the supplier know the approximate time of the 
audit in advance ("semi-announced audit"). This is necessary to make 
sure that relevant representatives and employees in key functions are 
present for the audit.
In doing so, we focus not only on Deutsche Telekom's direct suppliers 
but also on downstream suppliers as much as possible. We also boost 
the effectiveness of our audits by collaborating with thirteen other com-
panies in the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC). Due to the growing number 
of JAC members, the intersection of audited suppliers is also increasing, 
with multiple audits for individual suppliers being prevented.
We employ the "quality over quantity" principle when auditing suppliers. 
That is why we focus on some 250 strategically relevant and particularly 
risky suppliers among our more than 30,000 suppliers worldwide. We 
aim to audit these suppliers at least every two to three years.
We do not require our suppliers to obtain external environmental or 
social certificates. Based on our auditing experiences, however, the 
majority of our relevant manufacturing suppliers have an external "Envi-
ronment" and "Social Accountability“ certificate pursuant to ISO14001 
and SA8000 or comparable management systems. Verification of 
important social and ecological aspects as well as fundamental human 
rights during our audits is in line with internationally recognized guide-
lines and standards such as the ILO Labour Standards, the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the OECD Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises.
Based on all available sustainability-relevant information (from the 
E-TASC information system, our own research, audits, and pre-qualifica-
tion results), we classify and evaluate suppliers according to CR criteria 
(step 3). This is done using supplier scorecards, which let us assess a 
supplier's sustainability performance and compare them with other 
suppliers at a glance.

We work closely with our suppliers to address and resolve any acute 
problems that are identified. The subsequent process for improving the 
sustainability performance of these suppliers aims at long-term, continu-
ous progress. This will primarily take place through our supplier devel-
opment program (step 4).
In cases of significant disregard of our requirements, we initiate an 
escalation process to effect fast resolution in accordance with our  
sustainability standards. If employees have concerns along our supplier 
chain regarding compliance with laws, internal guidelines, and stand-
ards of conduct, they can report these anonymously using our whistle-
blower portal.
TWO COMPANIES, ONE STANDARD: NEW SUPPLIER CODE  
FOR THE BUYIN JOINT VENTURE
One of the goals of the BuyIn procurement joint venture between 
Deutsche Telekom and Orange is to ensure a sustainable supply chain. 
To this end, both companies introduced a joint Supplier Code of Con-
duct (SCoC) in 2017. It specifies joint principles and values in the cor-
porate responsibility area and sets forth strict ethical, social, ecological, 
and human rights expectations and requirements for suppliers.
This Code can obviously not replace the laws and regulations of coun-
tries where our suppliers are active. Rather, its aim is to facilitate compli-
ance with these laws and regulations and guarantee that they are imple-
mented faithfully and effectively. As of July 2017, the Code applies to all 
procurement activities of Deutsche Telekom, Orange, and the BuyIn 
joint venture, that is:
 
All current contracts (new contracts)
 
Contract changes such as extensions and additional negotiations
 
Project negotiations (based on framework contracts of all types – 
except catalog call-offs)
 
Individual orders
The Supplier Code is a fixed component of the General Terms and Con-
ditions/General Terms and Conditions for Purchasing. All new suppliers 
must accept it within the scope of the supplier onboarding process.
DEMAND AND PROMOTE: OUR CR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
FOR SUPPLIERS
We collaborate as partners with our suppliers to make sure they are 
able to meet our high sustainability criteria with measures like our devel-
opment program for key strategic suppliers. Under this program we 
work together to come up with solutions for topics such as environmen-
tal protection, working hour regulations, and occupational health and 
safety. Better working conditions have a positive influence on employee 
loyalty and motivation, raise productivity, and improve the quality of 
products; a clear win-win situation for our suppliers as well as for our 
company. In April 2017 we welcomed three new suppliers in China to 
the program, which now counts 14 suppliers. The new participants are 
currently working on creating their CR improvement plans.
Improvements achieved in 2017
The program's successes are tangible. During the operational review 
meeting in November 2017 in China, we evaluated last year's results 
together with the suppliers. As in previous years, the program suppliers 
achieved significant improvements*, such as the following:
 
One supplier reduced its CO2 emissions by 8.8 percent.
 
Another supplier decreased staff churn by 7.4% thanks to improved 
working conditions.
 
One supplier introduced a CSR management system with goals and 
concrete action plans.
 
One of our Chinese suppliers, who manufactures set-top boxes, 
decreased monthly overtime hours from 87 to 71 hours per week.
 
Another supplier of smartphones was able to reduce its electricity 
consumption by 21 percent and increase recycled waste by  
11 percent.
 
A direct supplier who manufactures network hardware housing 
improved its health and safety measures, which resulted in 
decreased absences due to workplace accidents by 35 %.
The suppliers were once again honored for their performance in 2017. 
Significant and meaningful improvements of social or ecological 
aspects by our suppliers resulted in notable cost savings in 2017. Since 
the start of the program, total savings amounting to double-digit millions 
(in euros) could be achieved.
* All figures and success stories pertain to one year and to specific sup-
pliers (i.e. the above numbers do not represent cumulative statistics for 
all program participants).
The diagram shows the areas in which we audit the suppliers participat-
ing in our program. Using the results, we work with them to develop a 
plan for remedying any issues. Suppliers receive support from Deutsche 
Telekom experts as well as professional external consultants in apply-
ing these measures. All activities and results are documented so that we 
can gauge the effectiveness of the measures employed. These are cor-
rected, if needed.

We want to establish our supplier program as an industry-wide 
approach in 2018 using the GeSI ICT sustainability initiative. Participat-
ing suppliers will be trained using a web-based tool. After completing 
the training successfully, they will be able to use the tool independently 
so that they can in turn train their own suppliers. This way we hope to 
achieve larger economies of scale.
AWARD FOR CLIMATE PROTECTION ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN
The non-governmental organization CDP regularly assesses the climate 
protection activities of companies worldwide and compiles an index of 
leading companies called the A List. Suppliers publish their CO2 emis-
sions within the scope of the CDP supplier program. We ourselves act 
as a supplier to our customers. Just like the previous year, we were once 
again among the leading companies in 2017 and received the top 
grade "A."
We invited 195 suppliers in 2017 (compared to 181 in 2016) to partici-
pate in the CDP Supply Chain Program. These suppliers cover 73 per-
cent of our procurement volume. A total of 109 suppliers took part in 
the program (compared to 108 in 2016). They cover 66.4 percent of the 
procurement volume (2016: 65 percent).
In 2017 we were also again included in the A List based on the CDP's

Group level, a total of 89 audits was carried out in 2017. Like in the pre-
vious year, our activities focused on suppliers in Asia, particularly China, 
South Korea, Thailand, and India. We also conducted social audits in 
Latin America and Eastern Europe.
Audited suppliers included manufacturers in the areas of IT hardware, 
software, and services, as well as networks and devices. No cases of 
corruption or bribery nor any critical violations of compliance policies or 
the right to intellectual property were found during the audits.

DETAILED RESULTS 
We do not audit all of our suppliers (over 30,000) equally, but instead 
focus on strategically important and/or high-risk supplier groups. We 
focus on roughly 250 suppliers that are regularly audited every two to 
three years. The majority of these auditsis conducted within the scope 
of the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC).

Environmental requirements
The JAC Guidelines require suppliers to grant their employees the free-
dom of association and the right to collective bargaining, as well as a 
healthy and safe working environment. The following minimum require-
ments are applicable regarding working hours: a maximum of 48 work-
ing hours per week, a maximum of twelve hours of overtime each week 
and one day off after six consecutive days of work. We also demand a 
fair wage that enables employees a decent standard of living. Compli-
ance with all these requirements is reviewed regularly during our on-site 
audits. This also includes inspection of the features and quality of the 
working, sleeping, and cafeteria areas.
We do not require our suppliers to obtain external environmental or 
social certificates. Based on our audits, however, the majority of our rel-
evant manufacturing suppliers have an external certificate confirming 
compliance with ecological and social standards. Reviews of the major 
ecological and social aspects during our audits are compliant with the 
relevant international regulations and standards, such as the ILO core 
labor standards, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, and recognized management systems such as ISO14001 and 
SA8000.
Of the 89 suppliers we audited in 2017 (nine of which were in accord-
ance with the validated audit processes of the Responsible Business 
Alliance), around 29 percent (26 audits) were direct suppliers and 71 
percent (63 audits) were tier 2 and 3 suppliers – that is, indirect suppli-
ers.
In the course of the audits in 2017, a total of 581 violations of Deutsche 
Telekom's supplier requirements were discovered. In the process, a 
total of 634 violations were corrected in 2017, including several open 
improvement measures from previous years. Among the violations were 
22 unacceptable incidents and 156 critical findings; 94 violations were 
rectified. Examples of unacceptable and critical violations, as well as 
introduced improvement measures, are published here. Critical findings 
were discovered at 68 suppliers in the areas of occupational health and 
safety, environmental protection, labor practices, working hours, and 
wages and performance-related remuneration. There were no critical 
findings in the business ethics area. Like in past years, most of the viola-
tions were related to occupational health and safety (46percent, com-
pared to 47 percent in 2016), followed by working hours and wages 
with 17 percent (12 percent in 2016). The business ethics area took the 
third spot, with 13 percent (18 percent in 2016).

EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMATIC FINDINGS 
131
Production of electronic devices like smartphones is harmful to the 
environment and requires large amounts of water and energy. Because 
the production facilities of suppliers and manufacturers are often 
located in regions where water is scarce or the population does not 
have sufficient access to electricity, the availability of resources plays  
a more significant role there than it does in countries like Germany.
Moreover, valuable raw materials like metals are used in producing 
smartphones and other ICT products. Some metals, including  
tantalum, gold, tin, and tungsten, are extracted from ores, some of 
which are extracted in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of 
Congo under conditions that are inhumane and/or associated with civil 
war. The parties involved in conflict in the region use the profit for pur-
poses such as financing civil wars. However, Deutsche Telekom does 
not manufacture any ICT products itself: We purchase these products 
from international manufacturers and sell them at our stores, offer them 
in the context of service provision, or use them in our network infra-
structure. We require our suppliers to refrain from using any of these  
so-called conflict resources. We also support industry initiatives like the 
Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative, which work toward a more sustainable 
supply chain.

SUPPORTING RESPONSIBLE RESOURCE EXTRACTION
We require our suppliers to protect the environment and use resources 
responsibly. We have set forth these requirements in the document 
"Code of Human Rights & Social Principles"; they are also described  
in detail in our Supplier Code of Conduct. We require our suppliers to 
provide information on their activities as part of a self-assessment and 
conduct supplier audits to emphasize the importance of these require-
ments (audit results). In the scope of the audits, we check whether our 
suppliers use an environmental management system and how they 
manage their energy and water consumption, as well as other factors. 
We also explicitly ask them about their waste management system.
Handling critical raw materials
We collaborate with suppliers and industry initiatives to effect responsi-
ble raw materials sourcing. Although we do not purchase any raw mate-
rials ourselves, we do require our manufacturing suppliers not to use 
any conflict minerals or other such resources in their products. Our 
requirements are expressly and comprehensively set out in our "Coltan 
Statement" and "Statement on Extractives." These are an integral part  
of our contracts with manufacturing suppliers. The goal is for both our 
direct suppliers as well as their sub-suppliers to decrease social and 
societal risks that could be associated with the mining of resources.  
We verify implementation of our guidelines regarding conflict resources 
during our supplier controls as well. As a GeSI member we also actively 
support the GeSI Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). We strongly 
encourage our direct and indirect suppliers to utilize the RMI tools for 
ensuring responsible resource procurement.
Tantalum is a conflict resource. Recycled tantalum, on the other hand, is 
considered conflict-free, Telekom Deutschland is conducting a research 
project on reclaiming precious metals such as gold and tantalum from 
outdated network infrastructure components.
TOGETHER AGAINST CONFLICT RESOURCES
Deutsche Telekom has supported the Responsible Minerals Initiative 
(RMI) since it was founded in 2008 under the name Conflict-Free Sourc-
ing Initiative (CFSI). RMI is the largest business initiative for responsible 
raw materials sourcing. Its objective is to identify conflict resources and 
prevent their extraction and sale.
RMI is based on a working group that was founded in 2008 by the 
Global e-Sustainability Initiative and the Electronic Industry Citizenship 
Coalition industry associations (Extractives Working Group) to address 
sustainable raw materials extraction. Since then, the number of metal 
processing companies and smelters participating in RMI has continued 
to grow. A total of 255 of these companies have been audited in compli-
ance with the standard audit protocol (as of January 2018).
CROSS-SECTOR EXCHANGE FOR CONFLICT-FREE RESOURCES
In August 2017 we took part in a workshop titled "Conflict Minerals – 
Transparency in the Supply Chain" given by missio, the international 
Catholic relief organization in Germany. Experts of the Friedrich Nau-
mann Foundation, the Südwind Institute, the Federal Institute for Geo-
sciences and Natural Resources (BGR) and Deutsche Telekom reported 
on their experiences. We presented our commitment to raw material 
recycling with our cell phone collection program and our project for 
recycling the metal tantalum. The discussion also illustrated that this 
field is undergoing a lot of upheaval due to the new EU guidelines on 
transparency in the resource chain.

CLIMATE & ENVIRONMENT
CLIMATE & ENVIRONMENT
We are dedicated to protecting the climate and environment. To this 
end, we record and reduce CO2 emissions along our entire value chain. 
We are increasing our energy efficiency, using more and more renewa-
ble energy, conserving resources and decreasing environmental 
impact.
133
One of our goals is to reduce the negative environmental impact of our 
business activities. One important milestone is our climate target. By the 
year 2020, we are planning to reduce the absolute amount of CO2 emis-
sions we produce by 20 percent compared to base year 2008 (exclud-
ing T-Mobile USA). One step in this process is investing in energy-effi-
cient network technology.
And we are concerned with more than just reducing our own carbon 
footprint. We want to help our customers reduce their CO2 emissions as 
well. The GeSI SMARTer 2030 study shows that information and com-
munications technology may be part of the solution in the fight against 
climate change. Products such as our cloud and mobility solutions help 
reduce the amount of CO2 emissions our customers produce.
OUR INTEGRATED CLIMATE STRATEGY
We designed our integrated climate strategy following our Group strat-
egy "Leading European Telco". This is how we ensure that our climate 
protection measures are closely connected with our core business. Our 
integrated climate strategy includes four aspects of climate protection: 
CO2 emissions, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable 
products. For each one of these aspects, we have defined goals and key 
figures.
CO2 emissions 
To help us achieve this goal, we record all direct and indirect emissions 
using the globally recognized GHG protocol. The goal is to reduce our 
emissions by 20 percent by the year 2020 compared to the base year 
2008 (excluding T-Mobile US). We uphold this ambitious climate goal 
despite the challenges arising from fast growing data traffic and the 
consequent ongoing network expansion. In order to achieve this, we are 
focusing on areas with especially high energy consumption, such as our 
networks and data centers. We have already achieved a moderate 
reduction in emissions (excluding TMUS) over the past few years. To 
achieve our goal, we also want to increase the share of renewable 
energy.
Renewable energy
We are evaluating various options to increase our share in green energy. 
This includes purchasing energy certificates from renewable sources, 
generating our own renewable energy such as through the use of 
cogeneration (“CHP”) plants. Some national companies are setting a 
great example: T-Mobile Austria and OTE in Greece obtained 100 per-
cent of their electricity from renewable sources in 2017. We have intro-
duced parameters throughout the Group that can be used to assess 
electricity procurement in terms of sustainability. These parameters help 
us make our energy mix more transparent and increase the share of 
energy obtained from renewable sources at our company.
Energy efficiency
Because the operation of our network infrastructure calls for a consider-
able amount of energy, we are investing in modernization and energy-
efficient technology. For instance, we are migrating our network infra-
structure to IP technology, which is not only more powerful, but also 
consumes less electricity than existing technologies. In addition, we 
are working to process data traffic from no more than a few, particularly 
efficient data centers. In order to measure our progress, we use two key 
performance indicators (KPIs). They show the relationship between our 
energy consumption or carbon footprint and transported data volume.
Sustainable products
Many of our products and services provide sustainability advantages. 
They can help reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions, improve 
healthcare and make logistics more efficient. Since 2016 we have been 
measuring the amount of CO2 emissions that our customers can reduce 
by using our products and services. With our Enablement Factor ESG 
KPI, we set our emissions in relation to potential savings for our custom-
ers in order to evaluate our overall performance in climate protection. 
Moreover, we use the Sustainable Revenue Share ESG KPI to measure 
the share of sustainable products. These are products that provide sus-
tainability advantages and that do not entail any significant sustainabil-
ity risks.
Collaborating for climate protection
Effective climate protection calls for joint efforts on the part of business, 
politics, science and society. That is why we are involved in a number of 
German initiatives, such as the 2° Foundation, and international associ-
ations. One of these is the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). As an 
industry association, GeSI's vision is to help make society greener and 
more climate-friendly with the help of ICT solutions.

WORLD CLIMATE CONFERENCE: EXCITING DEBATES AND  
MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE 
In November 2017, the 23rd World Climate Conference took place 
under the presidency of the Fiji Islands in Bonn. Diplomats, politicians 
and representatives of civil society came together at the Conference of 
the Parties (COP). We contributed to the content of the Conference with 
an event and provided state-of-the-art infrastructure.
Digitalization for climate protection and sustainability
On November 14, 2017, our headquarters in Bonn were entirely 
focused on climate protection. The real potential of digitalization for 
climate protection is still being underrated. In order to change this, we 
have joined our stakeholders for a dialog about "The impact of ICT on 
climate change – curse or blessing". Along with our partner, the Global 
e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), as well as numerous stakeholders and 
experts from politics, civil society and corporations, we discussed the 
opportunities and risks of information and communication technology 
(ICT) for climate protection. In collaboration with partners, we presented 
products and solutions for connected and therefore sustainable life and 
work - for example, relating to e-mobility, Smart City and logistics.
Fiber optics for the climate summit 
For the 23rd World Climate Conference in Bonn, Deutsche Telekom 
provided the technical infrastructure. For the supply of the two tempo-
rary tent towns alone we laid over 25 kilometers of optical fiber and 
copper cables each - capacities that would also suffice for the supply 
of a small town. Antennas that were installed for the event ensured the 
necessary wireless capacity. In this way, the park in Bonn where the tent 
towns were located was equipped with modern, broadband communi-
cations technology that will also benefit future events.
The sheer amount of infrastructure that an event with over 25,000 
visitors requires can be seen in the following “Netzgeschichte” (network 
story):
ADDRESSING CLIMATE RISKS
In the context of our integrated climate strategy, we address the environ-
mental impact of our business and determine potential opportunities 
and risks that exist for us as well as for our stakeholders.
For example, extreme weather conditions as a consequence of climate 
change can have a negative impact on our business processes and lead 
to incidents or even network outages. A very real example for this was 
the storm Friederike, which lead to an outage of more than 600 cross-
connect cabinets and over 200 mobile base stations in early 2018. 
Such failures can massively impact the managementl of rescue opera-
tions, if not render them entirely impossible. In order to be able to react 
appropriately in these cases, our internal "Group Policy on Continuity 
and Situation Management" defines responsibilities, processes and 
measures. It also outlines how to handle emergency and crisis situa-
tions like floods. In addition, possible consequences of climate change 
are also taken into account when planning our future business activi-
ties. For instance, our network infrastructure is set up to be protected 
from storm conditions, changes in temperature and high winds.
Climate change also carries financial risks, whether from the introduc-
tion of a levy on CO2 emissions or an increase in energy costs. Our 
contribution to the mitigation of these risks is that we measure our 
own energy efficiency and develop measures for improvement. 
We also work on the reduction of our own and our customers' and sup-
pliers' CO2 emissions.
We report to the Board of Management quarterly on current climate 
risks within the context of our Group Risk Report. You willYou will find 
more information on risk management in the "Risks and Opportunities” 
section of our Annual Report.
With innovative solutions, we support our customers in mitigating their 
carbon footprint or in better adapting to the negative consequences of 
climate change. Some examples for this are innovative projects in the 
area of sustainable urban development and mobility, or real-time solu-
tions for agriculture. These do not only help reduce emissions, but also 
optimize the use of fertilizer, seed and machinery. An increase in crops 
can also contribute to preventing agricultural areas from expanding, 
which helps retain valuable rain forest areas.
RECOGNITION OF LEADERSHIP ROLE IN CLIMATE PROTECTION
German Sustainability Prize 2017: Deutsche Telekom AG is  
Germany's most sustainable large company.
For our uniform sustainability manage-
ment, we won the German Sustainability 
Award in December of 2017. Our com-
mitment to climate protection, for exam-
ple by operating energy-efficient net-
works or providing products that help 
our customers reduce carbon emissions, 
helped us win the award.
Repeated inclusion in CDP ranking
We made it onto the CDP Climate A List 
for the second time in 2017. CDP com-
mends companies that report their CO2 
emissions extremely transparently and in 
detail. Under the CDP, we have reported 
Group-wide not only Scope 1 and Scope 
2 emissions but also Scope 3 emissions 
from our business operations in Germany and almost all our interna-
tional companies since 2014.
Finalist for the 2017 German CRS Award
The German CSR Award is given out 
annually by the German CSR Forum and 
celebrates extraordinary performance 
in the area of CSR (Corporate Social 
Responsibility) and therefore the social 
engagement of corporations. In the year 2017, we made it into the final 
round in the category "CO2 avoidance as a contribution to climate pro-
tection."

Demand for fast data services with full-coverage availability is growing 
rapidly. That is why we continue to push the build-out of our infrastruc-
ture and increase data transmission rates. Despite constantly growing 
amounts of data, we are able to remain stable in our energy use due to 
our efforts to improve energy efficiency - for example in the upgrade of 
network infrastructure. Other focal points include how we operate our 
buildings, business trips and our fleet of company and service vehicles 
in Germany. Our vehicle fleet boasts roughly 24,000 vehicles in Ger-
many and is one of the largest in Europe.

PROTECTING THE CLIMATE
"We assume responsibility for a low-carbon society" is one of the key 
action areas of our CR strategy. We intend to keep this promise with the 
help of our Group-wide climate protection target, which was adopted in 
2013: to reduce our CO2 emissions by 20percent (excluding T-Mobile 
USA) by 2020 compared with 2008. We have specified a variety of 
measures and developed measurement tools to help us reach this goal.
New method to calculate our climate target
Increasing data traffic and the related network expansion are present-
ing us with considerable challenges. We need more performance and 
data centers, but at the same time we want to reduce our carbon emis-
sions and energy use. We are facing this challenge and continue to 
stand by our ambitious climate goal. We are focusing our activities for 
the reduction of emissions on areas with especially high energy con-
sumption, such as our networks and data centers. This way, despite 
increasing data volumes, we have already been able to achieve a mod-
erate reduction in emissions (excluding TMUS) over the past few years. 
Moreover, we will put a stronger focus on renewable energy. Renewable 
energy certificates have not yet been taken into consideration in the cal-
culation of our climate target. In the context of our annual climate goal 
monitoring, we have reviewed and revised the method for the calcula-
tion of our climate target. In accordance with the framework of the 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, we have been calculating our emis-
sions using the market-based method since 2015. We are now applying 
this calculation method to our climate target. This means that the pur-
chase of electricity from renewable energies through certificates or 
electricity from low-emission sources can also be taken into account. 
Consequently, we also adjusted the 2008 baseline to reflect the propor-
tion of renewable energy at that time. The baseline reduced from 2 602 
431 metric tons of CO2 to 1 481 400 metric tons of CO2. As a result, the 
climate target will be reduced to 1 185 120 metric tons of CO2 by 2020, 
which also represents a reduction of -20% compared to 2008. With this 
calculation method, we are at the forecasted level for 2017.
This is how we measure our progress
We measure our contribution to climate protection using different key 
performance indicators (KPIs) and thereby provide transparency to 
shareholders regarding our progress in realizing our climate strategy. 
The Carbon Intensity and Energy Intensity KPIs are used to analyze the 
relationship between our carbon emissions/energy use and the trans-
ported data volume. Using data volume as a reference parameter 
makes it possible to create a direct link to the performance of our net-
works. The Enablement Factor, PUE and Renewable Energy KPIs also 
serve the purpose of controlling and providing transparency regarding 
climate protection.

Direct and indirect emissions
Across the Group, we measure our emissions along the value chain on 
the basis of the internationally recognized GHG Protocol. This standard 
distinguishes between three CO2 emissions categories (Scope 1, 2 and 
3). Scope-1 and scope-2 emissions are what we use as the basis for the 
calculation of ourCarbon Intensity ESG KPI. We break down all carbon 
emissions in detail in the indicator section.
RECORDING SCOPE 3 EMISSION
Indirect emissions along the value chain, or Scope 3 emissions, make 
up the majority of our total emissions. Recording these emissions helps 
us design targeted measures to reduce our carbon footprint at a corpo-
rate and product level.
We have been fully disclosing the Scope 3 emissions generated 
throughout the Group since 2016. They came to 6,013,202 metric tons 
of CO2 equivalents in Germany, roughly 23 percent more than in the pre-
vious year. The reasons for this increase were more investment in net-
work expansion and positive business growth: increasing client num-
bers as well as the sale of high-quality services (especially triple-play) 
resulted in higher CO emissions during use of our services. T-Systems' 
emissions were included in the Group number for Germany in 2017.
Use of the consumer products we sold and leased as well as energy 
consumption of the devices used for our services account for the largest 
part of the Scope 3 emissions – both in Germany as well as Group-wide. 
Emissions generated by purchasing technology to expand our networks 
as well as the purchase of devices and other goods and services were 
significant as well.
The year 2017 marked the first time that, in addition to the national com-
panies in Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, we also recorded the 
Scope 3 emissions of T-Systems units, which also contributed to a 27 
percent increase of the Group number compared to 2016. The numbers 
for the USA as well as for a few of the European countries from 2016 
were revised upward due to recalculations regarding the purchase of 
products and services.

ENABLEMENT FACTOR: CUSTOMERS SAVING ON CO2  
EMISSIONS
Our products and services not only connect people, they also help them 
reduce their CO2 emissions. That is why, in addition to calculating our 
own carbon footprint, we also calculate the positive CO2 effects facili-
tated for our customers through the use of our products and services. 
The ratio between these two figures – the "enablement factor" – allows 
us to assess our overall performance when it comes to climate protec-
tion. We began calculating the enablement factor in a pilot project 
launched in 2014. We were able to conduct fifteen case studies for our 
products in Germany in 2017. One study focused on the savings our 
customers achieved by using our cloud offers and outsourcing their 
infrastructure to our highly efficient data centers. In addition, we carried 
out five case studies for Europe.
Our findings: The positive CO2 effects facilitated for our customers in 
Germany in 2017 were 71 percent higher than our own CO2 emissions 
(an enablement factor of 1.71:1).
In all of Europe (incl. Germany), the savings potential for our customers 
was higher in 2017 than in the preceding year, with the factor having a 
value of 1.21 (2016: 0.95).

We always employ a conservative approach with our case studies and in 
our methodology. This applies to both the emissions reduction realized 
by our customers and our own emissions generated throughout the 
value chain. For example, we incorporate all levels of emissions genera-
tion when assessing our carbon footprint, including emissions from our 
own energy consumption (Scope 1 and 2) and also Scope 3 emissions 
generated by our suppliers and customers. The latter includes even the 
emissions produced by electricity consumption of our Entertain custom-
ers' TV sets.
COGENERATION PLANTS REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS
We are using combined heat and power (CHP) plants in addition to the 
conventional power grid.In the year 2017, we commissioned a new CHP 
module at the Berlin site. The majority of our 32 units in total (as of late 
2017) power our network nodes. The CHP plants convert the energy 
supplied by gas into electricity and heat. We use the waste heat pro-
duced on site to heat our office buildings, which brings overall energy 
efficiency to a level of up to 90 percent. As a comparison, electricity 
generated by conventional sources and fed through the general Ger-
man power grid has an efficiency level of roughly only 40 percent. This 
is how we can reduce the carbon emissions of our network operation 
through the use of CHP plants.
Sustainable urban district concept
A local heating pipeline runs from our CHP unit in Berlin to a neighbor-
ing school. With the waste heat of the plant, the heating needs of the 
school and its gym could be covered entirely in 2017. This helps reduce 
carbon emissions by up to 700 tons a year.
Updated CHPs save additional resources
In October of 2017, we completed the update of two CHP plants. 
Absorption chillers in both units now convert waste heat into cold air, 
which will then be used to cool network nodes. Additionally, environ-
mentally friendly dry coolers have also been installed in order to further 
reduce water consumption during the cooling process. The conse-
quence is that the use of water and chemicals needed for the operation 
of the CHPs can be reduced considerably in the future.
ROUGHLY 9,000 METRIC TONS OF CO2 COMPENSATED
Preventing greenhouse gas emissions is one of our top priorities. Invest-
ing in certified climate protection projects is one way to compensate for 
some of the CO2 emissions that we are unable to avoid generating or 
reduce, our increased commitment to purchasing renewable energy is 
another.
Telekom Deutschland compensated for further 8,971 metric tons of 
CO2 in the 2017 reporting year. These included emissions associated 
with our events (participant travel to and from the event, room usage, 
etc.) and certain products and services (e.g., conference calls or web 
conferences). Our Event Policy specifies the ways in which we compen-
sate for emissions generated by events.
OUR STRATEGY FOR CLIMATE-FRIENDLY MOBILITY
We pursue a three-pillar strategy to ensure a climate-friendly fleet  
management strategy:
 
Rightsize: selecting appropriately sized, energy-efficient, low-emis-
sions cars. By introducing our Green Car Policy we have also cre-
ated incentives for drivers of company cars to select smaller, more 
efficient cars.
 
Economize: encouraging a fuel-efficient, low-emissions driving style 
with driver training courses
 
Substitute: piloting and testing alternative mobility concepts.
We plan to keep average CO2 emissions levels of all of the new cars we 
purchase (company and service vehicles) below 95 g CO2/km by the 
end of 2020 in Germany.
Alternative engines
We can further reduce our fleet's carbon footprint by purchasing vehi-
cles with alternative engines and fuel systems. For a while now, we have 
been using a certain number of vehicles powered by natural gas and 
electricity. In the short and mid-term, we will considerably increase the 
share of alternative engines in our fleet. In the context of the regular 
renewal of the fleet, we will work together with the units and use gas or 
electricity driven cars where the use and circumstances allow it.
Extensive choice of mobility options
We also encourage our commuting employees to actively protect the 
climate by enabling them to buy discount season tickets for local and 
regional public transport. We also rely on other modern forms of mobil-
ity including our shuttle service, which we have been offering at a vari-
ety of locations for ten years, loaner bikes for getting around in the city 
and rental cars. Our employees benefit from the attractive option of 
buying bicycles and e-bikes through a salary sacrificing scheme.
ON THE GO AND GREEN: E-BIKES, SHUTTLES, RENTAL BIKES
Since 2015, we have offered our employees in Germany the chance to 
purchase a bicycle or e-bike as a green and healthy alternative, through 
deferred compensation schemes. With the support of Telekom Mobility-
Solutions, employees can lease a bicycle through their employer for 
three years. The monthly payments are subtracted from the employee's 
gross salary. The new offer has met with a tremendous response right 
from the off. By the end of 2017, roughly 3400  colleagues were already 
making use of this option - a considerable increase of 160 percent as 
opposed to the previous year.
We provide shuttle service between different locations, e.g., to the 
Cologne/Bonn airport or the Siegburg ICE train station to reduce the 
carbon footprint of business trips. Roughly 120,000 passengers used 
this service in 2017. Employees can use an app or visit the intranet to 
conveniently book a shuttle.
Our employees can also use bicycles available at more than 30 
Deutsche Telekom locations in Germany to get to their business 
appointments within the city.

Get to your customer faster with e-bikes
In 2017, we have started a pilot for our field service. Instead of using a 
car, some of our service technicians have been on the road with delivery 
e-bikes as a test. We have the hope to get to the customer faster in large 
cities and to improve our ‘on-time’ promise. Currently, six delivery 
e-bikes are in use in Hannover, Düsseldorf and Duisburg. We have also 
started a similar project in Stuttgart, where we are testing the use of 
scooters for field service staff.
ELECTRIC CARS IN US
There are still several hurdles to overcome before electric cars can be 
widely employed. Limited range, insufficient charging infrastructure and 
high procurement costs make the cars unattractive in many usage sce-
narios. It is particularly difficult to find suitable service vehicle models. 
There is a bright side, however. Thanks to the government environmen-
tal bonus, we were able to somewhat reduce the costs for electric vehi-
cles in our fleet. Nevertheless, our electric car projects have only been 
possible because project partners have supported the set-up of charg-
ing stations at our locations. We participate in selected electric mobility 
pilot projects in order to take advantage of the medium-term potential of 
electric mobility.
 
At our Bonn offices, for example, we offer four next-generation elec-
tric rental cars. Employees can use these cars for business trips free 
of charge.
 
Deutsche Telekom Technischer Service is currently using three 
electric service vehicles. Further electric service cars are used in 
Stuttgart and Munich.
 
We have two electric chauffeured cars in our management fleet  
for trips in the Greater Cologne/Bonn area and in Berlin. Charging 
stations for the car were set up on-site.
 
Since the summer of 2014, we have been gradually offering 
selected hybrid vehicles and, in certain regions, electric vehicles  
as company cars.
MAGYAR TELEKOM STAYS CARBON NEUTRAL
The Magyar Telekom Group stayed completely carbon neutral in 
2017and repeated its success from the previous 2 years. This achieve-
ment has put the company ahead of the largest telecommunication 
companies around the world. Our success is based on the purchase of 
100 % renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency, implementing 
carbon offset, and saving energy. The Group has defined an average 
emission value for our company cars and we reward compliance with 
the emission value. Users of cars with emissions above the reference 
values attracted penalty payments that were used for carbon offset. 
In 2017, we purchased CO2 certificates that offset 25,000 mt of CO2.
FOSTERING THE USE OF ELECTRIC CARS IN THE NETHERLANDS
In May 2014, T-Systems Netherlands introduced electric cars for lease 
drivers in order to help reduce the CO2 emissions discharged from the 
company’s cars. Charging stations have now been installed in parking 
areas to facilitate charging during office hours.
All-electric and hybrid cars help to reduce CO2 emissions as shown in 
the table below. The reduction in CO2 emissions is good for the environ-
ment and the lower tax rates provide a further major big advantage for 
drivers. These two benefits promote the popularity of these types of 
car in the Netherlands. This appeal is illustrated by the 24.5 % share of 
cars designed to reduce CO2 in the company’s fleet at the end of 2017.

Renewable energy is an important component in preventing the emis-
sion of greenhouse gases. We are therefore not only improving our car-
bon footprint by reducing our use of electrical power through energy 
efficiency measures, but are also optimizing the energy mix. The issue 
of renewable energies is one of the pillars in our four-pillar strategy for 
climate protection. Our national companies in Greece (OTE), Hungary, 
Albania, Austria and in the Netherlands are already pioneers in this 
field. 100 percent of their electricity came from renewable sources in 
2017.
OUR APPROACH FOR MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY
In order to specify our integrated climate strategy, we are currently work-
ing on suitable goals and strategies in the field of renewable energy. 
One thing is clear - we want to increase the share of renewable energy 
across the Group and thus reduce our carbon emissions. For this, we 
want to procure more power from renewable sources, but also buy  
corresponding power certificates. Where it is possible and sensible, we 
are already investing in our own power generating systems, such as the 
construction of cogeneration plants or the installation of solar systems.
Since 2016, we have been capturing the ESG Renewable Energy KPI.
The KPI is calculated based on the share of renewable energy in total 
electricity consumption. This is how it makes our progress in the area 
transparent. In 2017, the figure was at 41 percent across the Group  
(33 percent in 2016).
In addition, we have also introduced parametersthroughout the Group 
that can be used to assess electricity procurement at our national com-
panies in terms of sustainability. These parameters help us make our 
current energy mix transparent and increase the future share of energy 
obtained from renewable sources.

CLEAN ENERGY GENERATION: NEW SOLAR POWER SYSTEMS 
INSTALLED
At our technology sites in Germany, we are increasingly relying on solar 
energy. By the end of the year 2017, we were already operating a total 
of over 300 of our own solar photovoltaic plants. Two new plants were 
added in the reporting year. In total, the plants have a capacity of 
4,000kWp (kilowatt peak). In this way, we are reducing our ecological 
footprint by more than 1,700 metric tons of CO2.In 2017, only two addi-
tionalsolar plants (with a total of 16 kW) were installed.
With the additional expansion, we are approaching our goal to equip 
 a total of 600 sites with solar photovoltaic systems in the coming years. 
In 2017, we drew up a concept specifying how we can render more roof 
space usable for photovoltaic systems. Our internal energy service pro-
vider, Power & Air Solutions, is responsible for installing the systems.
MORE GREEN ENERGY AT EUROPEAN NATIONAL COMPANIES
In our European national companies, we want to increase the share of 
renewable energy in overall energy consumption to a level of at least 
10percent above that of the respective national energy mix on an 
annual basis. In the reporting period, we were able to further increase 
the share of renewable energy in the European national companies.  
On average, the share of renewable energy was registered at almost XX 
percentage points above the respective country mix*. To this end the 
national companies can also purchase renewable energy certificates 
(proof of origin) if needed.
Our national companies in Greece (OTE), Hungary, Albania, Austria and 
in the Netherlands are already pioneers in this field and cover 100 per-
cent of their electricity needs with renewable energies. T-Mobile US is 
planning on procuring its electricity entirely from renewables by 2021 - 
predominantly from wind power.
We are making the share of renewable energy transparent on a national 
company level:
* In the calculation of the share of renewable energy in electricity pro-
curement, the provider mix, the residual mix or the country mix is used 
as available, according to the IEA factor (in this order). The share of 
renewable energy in the residual mix is typically lower than the share in 
the country mix. For Germany, the EEG surcharge paid is taken into 
account when calculating the share of renewable energy.

Our network infrastructure forms the basis of our products and services. 
At the same time, network operation requires the most energy and 
therefore results in the largest carbon emissions, which makes achiev-
ing greater energy efficiency in network operation a key component of 
our climate protection target. When it comes to our networks, we 
engage in activities such as replacing outdated technology with new 
technology, e.g., the migration of our fixed-line network to IP technology. 
In addition, we are currently consolidating data traffic into only a few, 
particularly efficient, data centers.

OPERATING ENERGY-EFFICIENT NETWORKS
We operate our own fixed-line and mobile networks in Europe and the 
U.S. Much of our energy requirements come from operating this net-
work infrastructure. In the interest of our customers, we continue to 
increase the capacity and performance of our networks so that we can 
handle growing amounts of data and improve the speed and quality  
of data transmission. However, this also means higher energy require-
ments. We pursue three different approaches to reduce our energy 
needs.
 
We update our network infrastructure, e.g., by migrating to IP tech-
nology, and systematically removing equipment we no longer need.
 
We optimize energy generation and supply with the help of techni-
cal innovation.
 
We use more energy-efficient technology for lighting, monitoring 
and above all cooling our facilities.
Our internal energy service provider, Power & Air Solutions, which buys 
energy and then makes it available for use by our Group companies in 
Germany, plays a key role in these activities. Power & Air Solutions' 
energy management practices have been ISO50001 certified since 
2013.
Measuring and controlling energy consumption 
In order to measure our progress across the Group, we introduced two 
key performance indicators (KPIs). They show our energy consumption 
(Energy Intensity ESG KPI) and our carbon footprint (Carbon Intensity 
ESG KPI ) in proportion to the transmitted data volume. Using data vol-
ume as a reference parameter makes it possible to create a direct link to 
the performance and use of our networks. In the next few years, we are 
expecting a positive trend in both KPIs.
The PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) factor is measured annually and 
is another important performance indicator for managing our climate 
protection measures. Our state-of-the-art data centers, e.g. in Munich or 
Biere, are set up for a PUE value of 1.3 and are therefore much more 
efficient than the average of German data centers, which lie at about 
1.8. We are planning to reduce the PUE factor of our fixed-line network 
in Germany to 1.4 by the year 2020. For this value, we also forecast an 
additional reduction in the coming years. This will allow us in part to 
compensate for increasing energy requirements due to growing vol-
umes of data and new features.
MORE CAPACITY FOR OUR ENERGY-EFFICIENT DATA CENTER 
Our data center in Biere (near the city of Magdeburg) was put into oper-
ation in 2014 and is one of the world's most efficient data centers. And 
because demand for cloud services "made in Germany"is on the rise 
worldwide, we are currently expanding it to increase its server capacity 
by 150 percent. The foundation for the expansion of the data center has 
been laid:The new modules are scheduled to commence operation in 
the second quarter of 2018.
In 2017, a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) 
certification in Gold was requested for the expansion, just like it was 
requested for the first construction phase - an award that only very few 
data centers receive worldwide.

MEASURABLE SUCCESS: REDUCED CO2 GENERATION AT DATA 
CENTERS
We also keep our goal of reducing our carbon footprint in mind when 
planning and operating our data centers. To achieve this goal, we take a 
two-step approach. It starts with optimizing energy consumption at each 
data center site and then continues with improving processes through-
out the global data center landscape.
The key indicator for increased energy efficiency at our data centers is 
the PUE factor. We were able to reduce the average PUE factor at the 
T-Systems data centers in Germany from 1.85 to 1.54 between 2008 
and 2017. In comparison with the previous year, the figure remained 
constant in 2017. The reason for this is the ongoing consolidation of the 
data centers, where applications from less energy-efficient sites are 
migrated to new, highly efficient data centers. This increases the PUE 
value of the decommissioned data centers in the short term. Overall, 
this process lead to a constant PUE value across all data centers in the 
reporting year.
The DC11@2018 program for improving processes throughout our 
global data center landscape has been up and running since 2013. The 
project combines physical data center consolidation (i.e., reducing data 
center space and sites) with logical consolidation (i.e., virtualizing data 
center infrastructure). The objective of the DC11@2018 program is to 
consolidate global data center capacity at FMO (future mode of opera-
tion) data centers using the latest IT technology. In 2017, we continued 
to remain on schedule with this program. Within the scope of the physi-
cal consolidation, we decommissioned three old data centers in Ger-
many. At the same time, we further optimized air conditioning in the 
existing data centers in Biere and Munich.
The target average PUE factor at all FMO data centers in the Group will 
be 1.4 once the program has been completed in late 2018/early 2019. 
At the end of 2017, we were already at a PUE value of 1.51. This 
requires a homogeneous IT landscape combined with optimum capac-
ity utilization of data center infrastructure, IT hardware and the software 
running on the systems. For the year 2020, the latest program plans 
indicate accumulated reductions in CO2 by up to 51 percent compared 
to 2012.
Our target PUE factor for our highly efficient data center in Biere is 1.3. 
To achieve this target, it will be necessary to respect a given tempera-
ture level and to achieve a capacity utilization of at least 80 percent.  
We were not yet able to achieve the PUE target value in 2017.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN BUILDINGS
Our facility energy management activities focus on the two areas of 
heating energy and electricity consumption. We have defined sub- 
targets for each of these areas to help us attain our climate target in  
Germany. Twice a year, we measure our progress.
Two approaches help us achieve our sub-targets. We are reducing our 
office space as part of HR downsizing measures and are optimizing 
space usage by introducing new office concepts. We also identify 
needs for reduction in energy consumption by using specific indicators 
such as "kilowatt hours per square meter," "energy consumption at mid-
night" or "peak loads" to compare similar facilities. The energy manage-
ment system of Power & Air Solutions, the provider purchasing energy 
for the German Group companies, is certified according to the interna-
tional ISO standard50001.
Heat and hot water
In 2017, we used approximately 379 GWh of heating energy throughout 
Germany each year, primarily by using gas and heating oil as well as dis-
trict heating. The need has decreased continuously in the past years. 
We regularly assess the need for repairs at our properties and conduct 
profitability analyses to further reduce consumption. Keeping the availa-
ble budget in mind, we focus on the most necessary and particularly 
cost-efficient measures, including:
 
Optimizing heating systems 
 
Updating the heating system in line with the German Energy Saving 
Ordinance 
 
Using condensing boiler technology to replace old heating systems 
and pumps 
 
Recovery of waste heat produced by data centers 
 
Using CHP plants
In order to reduce the use of heating energy in our exchanges, we have 
reduced the starting temperature of the heating system to 12 degrees.
Electricity
Our employee workstations, lighting, and building technology, including 
pumps, ventilation, cooling and elevators, are responsible for the largest 
part of electricity consumption in our buildings. We focus our energy 
conservation measures on the following areas:
 
Using LED lighting and motion sensors
 
Using state-of-the-art pumps and fans
 
Switching off building technology outside working hours

ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTS IN GREECE
Energy Management System according to ISO 50001
The OTE Group has prioritized improvement in all the functions of 
energy performance and major company installations (office facilities, 
call centers, data centers and telecommunication networks). This is a 
response to global efforts directed toward mitigating climate change.
In 2016, OTE and COSMOTE achieved certification of two important 
buildings in their portfolio and five base stations in the mobile network 
in conformity with the ISO 50001 standard. The first year for implemen-
tation of the Energy Management System saw energy savings of some 
3.5% in each building and an average of about 16 % in each base sta-
tion. In 2017, the Energy Management System successfully expanded 
to seven important new facilities including technology andoffice build-
ings, call centers, data centers, and the head office of the OTE Group. 
The system has also been expanded to seven base stations in the 
mobile network. 
The strategic aim of the OTE Group for 2018 is to further enrich its port-
folio with a significant number of facilities certified according to ISO 
50001.
“Green” building with LEED Gold Certification
The OTE Group respects the environment in practice and invests in the 
rational and sustainable use of energy throughout its operations. OTE 
Estate is a company of the OTE Group and it is responsible for the man-
agement and commercialization of the OTE Group’s real estate portfo-
lio. The company organized and implemented renovation of a building 
(with total floor space of 10,850 m2) located in the historic center of 
Athens that houses part of the OTE Group’s Call Center services. The 
aim was to construct an environmentally sustainable building model 
capable of offering an ideal workplace for the Group’s employees.
The effectiveness of the building renovation was certified to gold level 
by the international LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design) certification scheme for environmental and sustainable build-
ings from the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). This is one of just 
few buildings in Greece with Gold level LEED certification and it is the 
second building in the portfolio of the OTE Estate to achieve this certifi-
cation.
The building’s GOLD level LEED certification constitutes a significant 
distinction that was achieved after a very demanding process. The 
objective is to improve performance for a series of indicators such as 
energy consumption, water use, CO2 emissions, the quality of the inter-
nal environment, and management of resources. Indicatively, the energy 
and environmental measures implemented in the building include the 
energy efficiency of the shell, installation of new electrical and mechani-
cal equipment with optimum energy performance, an automation and 
control system for monitoring and optimizing the operation of electrical 
and mechanical building installations, and implementation of an exten-
sive commissioning program during construction.
ENERGY STRATEGY AT T-MOBILE USA
The cross-functional energy team at T-Mobile USA representing retail, 
corporate real estate, critical facilities, network engineering, procure-
ment and sustainability meets several times annually to raise the profile 
of energy efficiency across the business. T-Mobile submitted its second 
Carbon Disclosure report in 2017.
Our key energy metrics, energy and carbon intensity both saw strong 
improvements in 2017:
 
Our energy intensity KPI decreasedfrom 549 to 430 kWh  
per terabyte. 
 
Our carbon intensity KPI decreasedfrom 260 to 192 kg C02  
per terabyte.
Theseimprovements largely resultedfrom a 67% increase in data traffic 
while only experiencing a 17% increase in energy usage. Efficiencies in 
our equipment allowed for greater traffic loads without requiring an 
equal increase in energy consumption.
Our Renewable Energy Commitment: 
In 2017, T-Mobile made a commitment to move toward 100% renewa-
ble energy usage by 2021. Early in the year, we made the largest wind-
power investment ever by a U.S. wireless company, buying up to 160 
MW of renewable energy credits from the Red Dirt wind power project 
in Oklahoma. A second investment in the new Solomon Forks Wind Pro-
ject in Kansas is underway.
The combined production of the Red Dirt Wind Power and the Solomon 
Forks Wind Project is a total contracted capacity of 320 MW, the largest 
amount held by any US wireless company and a landmark holding in 
the world of wind energy.
These 12 and 15-year clean energy contracts will reduce T-Mobile’s 
operating CO2 emissions across our US retail stores, call centers, and 
network operations by 60 percent over the next two years.
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY DATA CENTERS IN AUSTRIA
Operating data centers requires a great deal of energy and T-Systems 
Austria is dedicated to running its data centers in a maximally environ-
mentally friendly approach. Mitigation makes our data centers in 
Gmünd, Linz and Vienna entirely carbon neutral. Mitigation means that 
resources are used to absorb the same amount of CO2 asemitted by 
production of the energy necessary to run them.
We are also actively engaged in initiativesto reduce energy consump-
tion. A “cold/heat technique” is used in server cabinets to regulate the 
temperature as efficiently as possible with resultant savings in energy. In 
2017, we expect to achieve atotal energy reduction of 389,522 kWh. 
This yields a year-on-year reduction of 63 percent.
Our fire-extinguishing system has also been designed on environmental 
principles. Our data center at theT-Centerin Vienna has168fire extin-
guishersfilled with a mixture of nitrogen, argon and carbon dioxide for 
emergencies. The extinguishing agent is harmless to humans, leaves no 
residue, and is 100 percentenvironmentally neutral.

Several measures are being implemented to help save energy in 
our offices. These include replacement of fluorescent lamps with LED 
lamps, installation of motion sensors, and monitoring of the air condi-
tioning system in all offices. As a result, a 9.5% saving in watts was 
achieved in 2017 compared with 2016. Moreover, we were able to 
implement efficient measures in energy consumption, such as photovol-
taic cells. This allowed for a saving of 15% of the entire consumption of 
the facilities.
PROGRESS AT OFFICE BUILDINGS AND DATA CENTERS AT 
T-SYSTEMS NETHERLANDS
Since 2016, our office building in Vianen has been supplied entirely 
with green energy (100 %). Our offices in Heerlen and The Hague can-
not be supplied with green energy due to the fact that there are other 
tenants in the building and to the strategy of the owner of the building.
In 2017, we focused on improved efficiency for the floor space of our 
office buildings. A significant decrease in floor space will be achieved 
as a result:
 
at the end of 2018, a decrease of 50 % in The Hague and
 
at the end of 2019 a decrease of 40 % in Vianen.
The main focus for our data centers in 2017 was the significant 
decrease of floor space and energy consumption (28 % less energy 
consumed by comparison with 2016, 13 % less energy consumed by 
comparison with 2015). This was achieved through asset refresh (life-
cycle management), decommissioning, and data-center consolidation.

SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS
Our products and services contribute to more sustainability. With solu-

ing, lighting and electrical devices in a way that they only consume 
energy when the customer is at home. This lowers energy consumption 
and preserves resources. Our cloud solutions are another excellent 
example of how our products can help customers considerably reduce 
CO2 emissions. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that take 
advantage of cloud solutions can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 21 
metric tons each year on average. This is because, instead of being 
operated on the customer's premises, applications are shifted to effi-

drive. Doing away with your hard drive conserves natural resources, 
reduces electricity consumption and generates less waste.
The "sharing instead of owning" approach also contributes significantly 
to resource conservation. Numerous sharing economy offers such as 
car-sharing become possible thanks to digitalization. We have set the 
goal for ourselves to support suitable concepts with our expertise and 
to advance them with respective offers.
Another solution approach is the responsible use of raw materials. It is 
our goal to reintroduce raw materials obtained from outdated products 
to the production process, which is why customers can return their out-
dated devices to us for proper recycling.

SAVING RESOURCES AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT
With our health, safety and environmental management system (HSE) 
we have made a commitment to continually improving our performance 
in these areas. The system is based on international standards OHSAS 
18001 on occupational health and safety and ISO 14001 on environ-
mental management.
As a service provider, we use considerably less resources than manu-
facturing companies. The resource utilization for the manufacturing and 
use of our products occurs in up- and downstream stages of the value 
chain - at our suppliers and customers. Within our value chain, we are 
committed to the responsible handling of resources. This means that we 
support the responsible use of raw materials by our suppliers and the 
re-utilization of materials by our customers. For example, we support 
cell-phone collection initiatives in various countries to facilitate the 
recovery of valuable resources. For this purpose, we have introduced 
the Used Cell-Phone Collection ESG KPI, which compares the number 
of cell phones in circulation (excluding TMUS) to the number of col-
lected devices. We support cell-phone collection initiatives in different 
countries to facilitate the recovery of valuable resources. For this pur-
pose, we have introduced the Used Cell-Phone Collection ESG KPI, 
which compares the number of cell phones (excluding TMUS) in circu-
lation to the number of collected devices.
We regularly collect Group-wide data on the amount of waste we pro-
duce. Our International Waste Management Framework guarantees 
standardized guidelines for all of our national companies. They are 
required to use this framework as a basis for identifying their own meas-
urable targets and then monitor target achievement. This approach 
makes it possible to flexibly address the specific requirements of each 
country and company without working with quantitative objectives.
Resource efficiency is also a priority at the workplace. We use recycled 
paper and energy-efficient multifunctional printers and encourage pro-
curement of green office materials. In order to reduce the amount of 
paper used throughout the Group, we ask our employees to have their 
salary statements sent to their "De-Mail" account instead of having a 
printout sent by post. Around 20 percent of employees have already 
canceled delivery by post.
WASTE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING
Our waste management is organized according to uniform principles 
across the Group. The implementation lies in the responsibility of the 
national companies. On a Group level, we have not set a goal for the 
reduction of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Instead, our national 
companies are developing their own waste strategies or updating their 
current strategies on the basis of our International Waste Management 
Framework, which we adopted in 2013. They are also setting their own 
targets, with the reduction of hazardous waste such as lead batteries 
having top priority.
Requirements for Group-wide copper cable recycling
Copper cables were a main component of telephone lines for decades. 
These are being replaced over the course of our fiber-optic roll-out. In 
January 2016, we therefore introduced a Group-wide, mandatory policy 
requiring copper cable recycling. This policy provides a guideline to our 
national companies when it comes to recycling and disposal of used 
cables.
TESTING ON RECOVERY OF TANTALUM FROM ELECTRONIC 
SCRAP
With our switch-over to IP technology and dismantling of analog infra-
structure, we will be removing tons of old electronics over the next few 
years. We intend to recover precious metals such as gold and tantalum 
from the scrap. However, there are not yet suitable recycling methods 
for all metals. The tantalum used to manufacture condensers is 
extracted from coltan, which is considered a conflict resource. For this 
reason we have been conducting a project together with the bifaUm-
weltinstitut environment institute since 2013. The goal is to develop the 
perfect method for disassembling and recycling tantalum condensers. 
Different manual and automated methods for disassembling tantalum 
condensers were tested. Based on the results, we opted for an auto-

mated method in 2016. The circuit boards will be disassembled using 
thermal treatment. In order to implement the method in regular opera-
tions, a sufficiently high amount of electrical waste would be required. 
In 2017, we have not yet been able to provide this. We are planning to 
implement this method starting in 2018.
SALE AND REUSE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIP-
MENT IN SPAIN
Since 2012, T-Systems Iberia has been handing over redundant
 electrical and electronic equipment to Kapema, a company committed 
to refurbishing and reselling this type of equipment. Employees at 
T-Systems are given top priority for the resale of any equipment. This 
scheme has greatly reduced the amount of electrical and electronic 
waste generated. During 2017, 543 laptops and 96 desktops were sold. 
This has exerted a significant impact as a result of reducing emissions 
from devices by 2,844 kg.
COSMOTE PROVIDES REFURBISHED EQUIPMENT
The OTE Group integrates the principles of the circular economy in its 
operations across its value chain.
Since September of 2013, contracts for fixed telephony, internet and TV 
have included lease provisions for the equipment provided (provided 
that the customer chooses to obtain the necessary equipment from 
COSMOTE) at no cost. This is intended to expand the lifetime and over-
all utilization of the equipment provided to customers of COSMOTE and 
the GERMANOS retail network, and ensure proper end-of-life manage-
ment for end-devices. According to these conditions, operation of the 
equipment is covered by a guarantee while the client is under contract. 
The client is obliged to return the equipment after the contract comes 
to an end. Returned equipment undergoes detailed control checks and 
is repaired as necessary. It is then returned to the market in fully opera-
tional condition. COSMOTE cooperates with licensed disposal compa-
nies, and discarded equipment is forwarded to them for recycling.
As a result, consumption of resources and waste generation rates are 
reduced and the value of the embedded resources is maintained in the 
economy for as long as possible, while customers benefit from lower 
costs for high quality services.
Highlight figures for 2017:
 
All new contracts (residential and business customers) included 
lease options at no cost for terminal equipment
 
147,897 items of equipment were checked and 115,239 items were 
refurbished and returned to the market.
 
During the period from 2013 to 2017, around 259,092 items were 
recycled.

We assume responsibility for creating a climate-friendly society – at our 
company, among our customers and suppliers and through our social 
commitment. We focus on those areas where we can make the most 
impact.
Other environmental topics are addressed as well, such as protecting 
biodiversity and responsible water consumption. Our infrastructure 
can also be a part of our solution – for example, with the "Bee and Me" 
project, which helps beekeepers protect their bees.
PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY
Species extinction is occurring at an alarming rate worldwide, and the 
consequences are difficult to predict. One major cause of extinction is 
the fact that more and more space is being taken up by industry, agri-
culture and transportation. When it comes to our environmental impact, 
the topic of land usage plays a subordinate role for us. Deutsche 
Telekom's business operations primarily impact biodiversity at the 
beginning of the value-added chain. This impact is clearly diminished 
at later stages.
Nevertheless, we are concerned about protecting biodiversity. To this 
end, we develop and support ICT solutions that can help maintain 
biodiversity. Furthermore, we influence the maintenance and enhance-
ment of biodiverse habitats in the direct surroundings of our various 
locations. That is why we collaborate with competent partners on nature 
conservation efforts near us.
Fighting bee mortality with narrowband technology
Deutsche Telekom supports solutions that help maintain biodiversity. 
One example of this is a solution by start-up company "Bee and Me" 
from Montenegro. This young company uses narrowband technology 
NB-IoT (Narrowband Internet of Things) for optimizing apiculture. With 
this technology, data relevant to the beehive, such as temperature, rela-
tive humidity, air pressure, weight and bee activity, can be recorded and 
sent to the beekeeper using an app. This allows the beekeeper to take 
immediate action if the beehive is in danger.
Renaturation of biodiverse habitats
Since 2003 we have been carrying out comprehensive collection 
campaigns for used cell phones. The cell phones are then reused or, 
if they are no longer functional, properly recycled in an environmentally 
responsible manner. We use the profits from these collection cam-
paigns to support charitable organizations, especially in the fields of 
resource protection, environmental protection, nature conservation and 
education. In 2017, we supported two biodiversity protection projects – 
a gorilla protection project sponsored by the Frankfurt Zoological Soci-
ety as well as the monkey orphanage J.A.C.K. sponsored by Pro Wildlife 
e.V. Both organizations have been partners in the cell phone collection 
center since 2017. You can find more information at 
www.handysammelcenter.de.
Cooperation with Environmental ActionGermany ended
We supported the nature conservation projects of Environmental Action 
Germany from 2003. This cooperative venture was terminated at the 
end of 2017.
INITIATIVES FOR RESOURCE EFFICIENCY AT THE WORKPLACE
We try to use as many green office supplies as possible in order to 
improve resource efficiency at the workplace. A total of 16% of prod-
ucts are classified as sustainable in our office products catalog in 
Germany. This includes paper that has been distinguished with the 
"Blue Angel" eco-label or the "Nordic Swan" certificate. Some of our 
office products have also been honored with the EU Flower eco-label, 
the Fairtrade seal, and the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) and the 
PEFC (Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes) 
eco-labels. In 2017, the percentage of sustainable products ordered 
was 96%.
During this year, we repeatedly sold remaining stock, giveaways and 
corporate clothing to our employees at our Bonn location as well as in 
the online shop. These activities were very well-received this year as 
well. The office supplies swap meet has become a fixture in Bonn, an 
event during which colleagues can pick up discarded office supplies 
from other departments instead of ordering new products.
We also entered into a cooperative venture with the non-profit organiza-
tion "Afb social & green IT" in 2017. Within the scope of this venture, we 
will give some of our used IT hardware (e.g. laptops) to the organization 
so that it can recondition and resell this. This will not only help us save 
resources but also create jobs for people with disabilities as well as 
extend the life cycle of our used hardware. We held a very successful 
on-site sales promotion at our Bonn location at the end of November 
2017 within the framework of this cooperation.
WATER CONSUMPTION
We need water to live and it continues to grow scarcer. The World 
Health Organization estimated that more than one billion people world-
wide do not have access to clean water. As a service provider, our water 
consumption is comparatively small compared to the agricultural and 
manufacturing industries. We almost exclusively use water within the 
scope of our office activities. Water consumption also plays but a minor 
role along our supply chain. For that reason, water is not a main focal 
area in our CR management activities. Nevertheless, we use our Water 
Consumption KPI to record our annual water consumption, which we 
have been able to consistently reduce since 2012.

SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT ESG KPI
The Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI remained on a stable level 
against the prior-year figure. The share of the procurement volume that 
has been risk-assessed momentarily amounts to 81 percent. Over the 
next two years, we expect our Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI to 
remain stable at a high level. Our aim is to keep a coverage of at least 
80 % until 2020.
We measure the degree to which our procurement volume is covered  
by sustainable activities with the Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI. It 
measures the share of procurement volume we obtain from suppliers 
where one or several Group companies of the corporate group have 
been assessed for compliance with our social and environmental stand-
ards by way of self-assessments and/or audits. This also applies for 
audits carried out on subcontractors. In the coming years we expect  
our Sustainable Procurement ESG KPI to stay at a constant level.

sustainability criteria according to Self-Assessments, Audits, Supplier 
Sustainability Workshops and Supplier Development Programs. The 
share of suppliers taken from the Top 200 pool amounts to 72 percent 
in 2017. Our target is to reach 75 percent by 2020.

The percentage of audited procurement volume decreased slightly from 
36% in the previous year to 33% in 2017. At the same time, the per-

cent. A supplier prequalification process via the Supplier Management 
Portal (SMP) took place for 64% of the procurement volume in 2017, 
compared with 63% in the previous year. Prequalification is mandatory 
for all suppliers for which we anticipate an order volume of more than 
100,000 euros. In 2017, all suppliers whose qualifications had expired 
or were still pending or not yet completed were asked to complete the

NETWORK BUILDOUT
We again made significant investments in the broadband and fiber-optic 
buildout, our IP transformation, and our mobile infrastructure as part of 
our integrated network strategy.
We are building an IP-based network with high transmission band-
widths so that, in the future, we can offer our customers competitive 
high-speed lines, e.g., by migrating our VDSL network to vectoring  
technology. In addition, we are investing heavily to offer greater cover-
age and even higher speeds in rural areas as well. We are also using 
innovative products for this purpose – like our hybrid router, which 
combines the transmission bandwidths of fixed-network and mobile 
communications, thus enabling much higher transmission speeds.
Part of our network strategy is to also systematically build out our 
mobile networks with 4G/LTE technology to increase transmission rates 
in all our national companies. Thanks to investments in our 4G/LTE  
network, our customers enjoy better network coverage with fast mobile 
broadband. In 2017, we already supplied 94% of the population of  
Germany with LTE (94 % in Europe). This puts us right on schedule to 
reach our goal of between 75 and 95 percent network coverage by 
2018.

SMART INNOVATION 
In this section, we will introduce some "Smart Innovation" solutions. The 
associated business models are based on the most advanced technol-
ogy and provide an immediate value-add for our customers. At the same 
time, these solutions are also making an ecological and/or social contri-
bution to society.
We are, for example, utilizing future-oriented and widely available tech-
nologies to make cities viable for the future and to develop solutions for 
social challenges. For this, we are relying on innovative  NarrowBand IoT 
(NB-IoT) technology, with which we are paving the way for the Internet of 
Things. NB-IoT devices have a large operating range and long battery 
service lives. Consequently, this technology provides the basis for many 
innovative uses that are both cost- and energy efficient. Particularly 
useful areas of application for NB-IoT are, for instance, smart parking, 
smart cities, smart meters, as well as transport and logistics solutions.
In early 2018, NB-IoT was already available in more than 600 cities 
and municipalities in Germany, for instance in the metropolitan areas 
of Berlin/Potsdam, Cologne/Bonn, the Ruhr district, Mannheim/Heidel-
berg, and Stuttgart. Progressive rollout in the coming months will see 
many more cities in ten additional countries being equipped with the 
new infrastructure. In addition to the USA and Germany, the Nether-
lands, Greece, Poland, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, as well as the Czech 
Republic and Croatia will be included in this rollout.

In the area of e-health, we are highlighting, for the reporting year, two 
innovative applications that provide added social value, in particular, for 
our customers and for society: the game Sea Hero Quest gives scien-
tists important insights into the spatial  navigation ability of individuals 
of all ages, within minutes – and thus 150 times faster than with conven-
tional research methods. Gamers thus make a direct contribution to 
dementia research while having fun. The other e-health solution, iMe-
dOne®, is a hospital information system. It creates optimal conditions 
for connected work and supports hospital processes in multiple ways. 
This means that physicians and nursing staff, for instance, are able to 
access required data and functions at all times and everywhere. This 
makes a significant contribution to cost-efficiency and quality improve-
ment. An efficient and fully integrated hospital information system that 
can be used on mobile devices thus improves the quality of care.

A random sample of 50,000 Telekom employees are surveyed on the

survey are used, for example, to determine the Security Awareness 
Index (SAI) and the Data Protection Award indicator. The indicators help 
us to review the effectiveness of our measures in the areas of IT security 
and data protection.
The Data Protection Award indicator measures the level of data protec-
tion within the units. It is calculated based on what the employees said 
they thought, did and knew about data protection.
The Security Awareness Index measures our employees' perception of 
IT security at Deutsche Telekom. The assessment is based on Deutsche 
Telekom employee answers on management awareness of the topic, 
the security culture, the influence of security requirements on their own 
work, and their personal responsibility for and attitudes towards IT secu-
rity. The index includes a scale from 0 to 100 – the higher the value, the

NET VALUE ADDED
The net added value increased from 34.1 billion euros to 42.8 billion 
euros is primarily the result of increased payments for investments, in 
particular in the course of the spectrum auction of FCC licenses in the 
USA, which was finalized in April 2017, and of continuously high invest-
ments for the network expansion in the USA and the fiber-optic network 
expansion in Germany. The payments to investors also increased as a 
result of premature and scheduled repayment of bond liabilities for 
2017 and the repayment of loans. The payments to employees slightly 
declined corresponding to the decreasing average headcount of the 
business year.
In contrast to the statement of income, the net value added only takes 
account of real payment flows. That means that deferred tax expenses 
and the accrual of provisions do not impact the net value added of the 
reporting period. Although these costs are deducted from net profit in 
the statement of income, they are not linked to any current payments to 
stakeholder groups, as is the case with net value added. Outpayments 
in this respect are scheduled for the future and will only be accounted 
for in net value added in future years.

PERSONNEL COSTS AND PERSONNEL COST RATIO 
By personnel costs we mean basic personnel costs (salaries) and inci-
dental personnel expenses – where applicable including, or adjusted 
for, special factors in conjunction with personnel restructuring measures 
(individual downsizing instruments). The personnel cost ratio represents 
personnel costs as a proportion of revenue. The development of this 
rate serves as a benchmark for company business. This performance 
indicator has fallen continually Group-wide since 2012 from 23.2 to 
today’s figure of 19.9 percent. The key driver of the Group’s adjusted 
personnel cost ratio, which fell by 0.4 percentage points, is the signifi-
cant rise in revenue. It more than compensated for the rise in personnel 
costs in the Group.
The disadvantage of the personnel cost ratio is that it ignores external 
personnel costs. Therefore the total workforce costs ratio is more mean-
ingful for the management of personnel costs at Deutsche Telekom.

TOTAL WORKFORCE QUOTA
Total workforce management allows HR to be managed in a holistic 
manner, enabling qualitative and quantitative personnel planning over 
the long term. The total workforce ratio describes the relationship 
between all personnel expenditure and revenue. This means: if the ratio 
has fallen in comparison with the previous year, either revenue has 
remained constant while total workforce costs have gone down, or  
revenue has increased with stable Total Workforce Cost.
The quota has dropped continually since 2014 in the overall Group: 
from 24.6 percent in 2014 to 22.5 percent in 2017. It has also dropped 
internationally: from 16.6 percent in 2014 and 2015 as well as 16,2 per-
cent in 2016 to 16 percent in 2017. In Germany, the ratio has decreased

Since 2016, we have reported on the Energy Intensity ESG KPI. In con-
trast to the existing Energy Consumption ESG KPI, the new ESG KPI 
shows energy consumption in proportion to the transmitted data vol-
umes. Using data volume as a reference parameter makes it possible
 to create a direct link to the performance of our networks. The KPI is 
reported for DT Group EU and T-Mobile US.
The ESG KPI figure also takes into account total energy consumption 
for all energy sources – fuel, gas, district heating and electricity. The 
data volume is composed of the transmitted IP data volumes (including 
Voice over IP, Internet, IP-TV).
Reporting against standards
The Energy Intensity ESG KPI is relevant for the GRI indicator GRI 302-3 
(Energy Intensity). This information is relevant for EFFAS KPI E01-01 
(Energy consumption, total). It is furthermore relevant for criterion 12 
(Resource management) of the German Sustainability Codex. It is also 
used for reporting on the Global Compact Principles 7 (Precautionary

TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION
Total energy consumption indecreased by 5 percent year over year as a 
result of the rapidly growing data traffic and the corresponding continu-
ous network expansion. In order to achieve our climate goal, we are 
focusing on areas with especially high energy consumption, such as our 
networks and data centers. For instance, we are migrating our network 
infrastructure to IP technology, which is not only more powerful, but also 
consumes less electricity than existing technologies.

RENEWABLE ENERGY ESG KPI
Due to the steadily increasing relevance and strong reference to the 
integrated climate strategy, the data on "Renewable energies" was 
reported for the first time in 2015 and listed for the first time as an ESG 
KPI in 2016. The KPI is calculated based on the share of renewable 
energy in total electricity consumption. We are committed to increasing 
our reliance on renewable energy throughout the Group. To this end, all 
European national companies can purchase renewable energy directly 
as well as energy certificates if needed.
The share of energy from renewable sources used by Deutsche 
Telekom was 41 percent in 2017. The average share of renewable 
energy in the country mix in all countries where Deutsche Telekom is 
active was 30 percent. The share of renewable energy purchased 
through the country mix amounted to 26 percent ("remaining" country 
mix).

c) The country mix is u sed as the basis when calculating the share of 
renewable energy in total electricity consumption, as no data is availa-
ble regarding the share of renewable energy in the residual mix.. The 
country mix was calculated based on publicly available sources (Euro-
pean Commission, US Energy Information Administration). The share of 
renewable energy in the residual mix is typically lower than the country 
mix. For Germany, the EEG surcharge paid is taken into account when 
calculating the share of renewable energy.
  Data assured by PwC. The 2017 calculation was based on the utili-
ty’s electricity mix for the first time, which also takes renewable energy 
from the EEG surcharge into account for Germany.. The 2017 calcula-

DECOUPLING POWER CONSUMPTION AND CO2 EMISSIONS
Deutsche Telekom was able to reduce the emissions generated by its 
electricity consumption to zero from 2008 to 2012 by purchasing RECS 
certificates (Renewable Energy Certificate System). However, we feel 
that these certificates have not had as positive an impact on the environ-
ment as we had hoped. Demand for certificates was generally limited. 
As a result, RECS certificates do not make a noticeable contribution to 
encouraging the expansion of renewable energy sources. That is why 
we feel it makes more sense both in terms of ecological and economic 
aspects to invest in reducing our energy consumption and increasing 
our energy efficiency than to purchase RECS certificates.

It is calculated as the ratio between the total electrical energy consumed 
by the data center and the electrical energy consumption of the IT. 
Between 2011 and 2017, we were able to reduce the average global 
PUE value of our T-Systems data centers from 1.85 to 1.64.

CO2-EMISSIONEN GESAMT (SCOPE 1 & 2)
Our CO2 emissions are largely driven by our electricity consumption.
That's why the table below contains very detailed information about the
Group numbers for the Scope 2 emissions resulting from our electricity
consumption. We differentiate between the established market-based
and location-based methods, thereby adhering to the GHG Protocol
Scope 2 Guidance.
The market-based method is the leading method in the CR report start-
ing this reporting year. This method is used to calculate emissions with 
a specific emissions factor (provider factor) per DT company. This factor
depends on a company's actual energy procurement (electricity mix);
procuring renewable energy (direct purchase, certificates) reduces 
emissions.a)
In contrast to the market-based method, with the location-based method
the emissions factors for the respective country are used (the country
mix factor of the International Energy Agency (IEA). A company's actual
energy procurement (electricity mix) is hence not taken into account, so
neither is the procurement of renewable energy.
For reasons of continuity, we also report the emissions calculated with
the previous method. This means that - just like with the location-based
method - the IEA factors were used, but that emission reductions from
the procurement of renewables (direct purchase, certificates) were also
taken into account.
Change compared to last year: The Scope 2 emissions calculated
according to the market-based method are about 30% less compared 
to last year. The decline is primarily due to more favorable supplier fac-
tors, the direct purchase of renewables from our national companies in 
Croatia, the Netherlands and the U.K., and the in part additional recog-
nition of energy certificates (RECS, GOO, PPA) b) at our national com-
panies in Greece, Hungary Germany, Austria as well as in Poland and 
Slovakia.

ENABLEMENT FACTOR FOR DT GROUP IN GERMANY 
We also calculate the positive CO2 effects facilitated for our customers 
through the use of our products. We combine this figure with our own

performance in relation to climate protection. According to this figure, 
the positive CO2 effects facilitated for our customers in Germany were 
71 percent higher in 2017 than our own CO2 emissions (enablement 
factor of 1.71 to 1).
The positive CO2 effects facilitated for our customers through the use of 
our products and solutions rose from 8.6 to 12.8 million tons in 2017. 
The main drivers for this development were the three categories audio 
conferencing, ride sharing and accommodation sharing which were not

emission-reducing products and services (+ 3.5 million tons), especially 
in the segments connected car (+ 1.5 million tons), broadband services

ues and the positive CO2 effects on the customer side (now including 
smart logistics), the value of the Enablement Factor ESG KPI for the

We are reporting the Take Back Mobile Devices ESG KPI img based on 
the reference value "number of devices in circulation." This makes it 
possible to more precisely illustrate the ratio of the number of cell 
phones brought to market to the number of used devices collected. 
When customers use the devices for longer periods of time, the environ-
ment benefits from this decision and, as a result, this has a positive 
impact on the KPI. Around 308 thousand mobile devices were collected 
throughout the Group (not including TMUS, AMC, Maktel, Crnogorski) 
in 2017, a slight decrease compared to the previous year. This dein-
crease against the previous year was driven above all by measures 
taken by our national company in the Netherlands and Hungary. At the 
same time, the number of devices brought into circulation in the major-
ity of our subsidiaries dropped.
At TMUS just under 4 million mobile devices were collected there alone. 
The KPI would be 100.7 for TMUS and 85.2 for Deutsche Telekom incl. 
TMUS.
The aim of the scheme to take back old cell phones is to give them a 
second life and, if that isn't possible, to properly recycle them to recover 
the valuable raw materials inside them. Thanks to this, over 3 million 
used cell phones have been reused or recycled in Germany since 2003, 
thus conserving resources. In this way, we have helped to improve the 
eco-balance of mobile devices. 
The Take Back Mobile Devices ESG KPI measures the ratio of collected 
devices (in thousands) to the number of devices in circulation (in mil-
lions). The collected devices are recorded in kilograms or in units. When 
using kilograms, we apply a Group-wide conversion factor of 7.25 units 
per kilogram unless another conversion factor is typically used in that 
country. Mobile devices in circulation include smartphones, simple 
phones, tablets and cordless phones. Units are reported by Procure-
ment for reasons of data quality.

BENEFICIARIES AND MEDIA LITERACY ESG KPIS
The report comprises a set of three KPIs for calculating the impact of 
our social commitment. In addition to the Community Investment ESG 
KPI, we report the Beneficiaries and the Media Literacy ESG KPI here. 
Our activities are based on the methods employed by the London 
Benchmarking Group (LBG), which incorporate the aspects, "input," 
"output" and "impact".
The Beneficiaries ESG KPI reflects the number of people who got 
involved in community activities and the number of people in the target 
group that participate in or benefited from such activities (e.g. media  
literacy trainings, DSL connection in schools and crisis helpline).
The Media Literacy ESG KPI reflects the share of people we have 
reached through programs addressing this topic. This KPI establishes 
a direct correlation between these activities and our core business. 
The ESG KPI reached 41 percent by the end of 2017 and our aim is to 
achieve a share of 45 percent by 2020.
ENGAGEMENT@TELEKOM
Employees at the national companies show their commitment to society 
in many different ways. This commitment (corporate volunteering) 
frequently focuses on helping people who are not yet able to help them-
selves - children and young people in need. Corporate volunteering 
is very popular at almost all of our national companies. Core data is  
collected within the context of international implementation of

SUPPORT FOR REFUGEES 
In view of the massive challenges involved in aid work for refugees, our 
Board of Management set up its own task force in August 2015. It pools 
our various aid programs in Germany to ensure that support can be 
provided faster and with less red tape. In 2017, more than 100 intern 
positions and about the same number of apprentice positions have 
been filled with refugees. Deutsche Telekom employees also initiated 
over 100 corporate volunteering projects. Further information is availa-

EMPLOYEE IDENTIFICATION WITH CR COMMITMENT ESG KPI
We use the Employee Identification with CR Commitment ESG KPI to 
determine the degree to which our staff identify with, or how satisfied 
they are, with our CR commitment. This is based on the Group 
employee survey (excluding T-Mobile US), which we conduct every  
two to three years.
The 2017 survey indicated - as in previous years - a considerable 
increase in employee identification and satisfaction with regard to  
our CR activities.

SATISFACTION AND COMMITMENT INDEX
The Employee Satisfaction KPI has improved steadily in recent years. 
This is largely due to sets of measures which guarantee improvements 
right down to individual teams. We base this on the employee survey 
carried out every two years and monitor how effective these measures 
are through the half-yearly pulse survey. This allows us to continuously 
analyze and optimize our processes. It gives us the opportunity to

through the "Fair Share" initiative.In Germany, the percentage of women 
in mid- and upper-level managementstays at 21.2 %. Group-wide, the 
value has not changed either with a steady 25.4 %.
Deutsche Telekom is one of the few DAX Groups where women have

Social Performance Report 
To review possible impacts on human rights, we have operated a central 
Contact Point for Human Rights since 2013, and we prepare a Social 
Performance Report each year. In the report, all 103 fully consolidated

principles of the Social Charter. The report again shows no violations of 
our Code of Human Rights & Social Principles (formerly Social Charter) 
for January to December 2017.

COMPANY PENSION SCHEMES
The increase in fund assets can be attributed to the payments of the 
increasing number of plan participants (as was the case in previous 
years). Because the majority of participants in the 2001 pension plan 
are still active, i.e., still paying into their retirement plans, this increase 
will remain steady over the next few years.
Investments in the capital market made by Deutsche Telekom for com-
pany pension schemes and similar obligations in Germany are based 
on our sustainability principles. These principles were integrated into 
our socially responsible investment strategy for Deutsche Telekom 
pension providers, which we introduced in 2013, in the form of exclu-
sion criteria. They prohibit investments in companies that produce NBC 
weapons, anti-personnel mines or cluster bombs or that trade in these 
or have repeatedly violated the UN Global Compact principles. 
Deutsche Telekom pension funds are also prohibited from purchasing 
government securities from governments that are subject to sanctions 
in accordance with public international law. Our pension providers 
agreed to our socially responsible investment strategy in 2013. This 
strategy was reviewed in 2017 and now incorporates Best-in-Class 
strategies and engagement approaches.
We are convinced that putting this strategy into practice will help 
improve our financial risk indicators. This strategy will also promote 
perception of Telekom as a socially responsible company. It will help us 
avoid high-risk, controversial investments and, instead, invest in long-
term, stable values that are in line with our principles of sustainability.

The Group-wide health index – calculated as part of the2017 employee 
survey in 30 countries – increased positively by 0.1 to 3.6 (on a scale 
from 1 to 5). From2018, new steps will be taken designed primarily to 
improve the health rate. These include, for example, a workshop in 
which managers learn about a range of short-, medium-, and long-term 
strategies to influence the health rate. They will also be given the skills 
to become more confident at handling healthy and sick employees.  
The initiative will be piloted in Germany with the goal of rolling it out

The Group’s headcount decreased by 0.5 percent compared with the 
year 2016. Employee figures were down in almost all segments. The 
total number of employees in the U.S. segment rose by 2.4 percent com-
pared to the previous year. New staff were recruited for the retail seg-
ment as well as for customer service and HR administration. In our 
Europe and Systems Solutions business, the employee base decreased 
as a result of efficiency improvements and personnel restructuring 
measures. Employee numbers in the Group Headquarters & Group 
Services segment were down 4.7 percent year on year. This increase 
of employees in the customer service and the network area was partly 
offset by the decrease of employees in the customer acquisition area. In 
the operating segment Europe, the headcount increased by 1.3 percent 
compared to the end of 2016. Amongst others, our national company in 
Poland contributed to this increase as they opened new branches and 
hired more employees. In the segment Group Headquarters & Group 
Services the number of employees decreased by 4.7 percent against 
the previous year. The number of employees in the operating segment 
Group Development was reduced by 23.5 percent. The main reason for 
this is the deconsolidation of Strato as of 31 March 2017. The number 
of employees in the segment Group Headquarters & Group Services 
decreased by 4.7 percent compared to the end of 2016. This was 
mainly due to the continuous staff restructuring at Vivento and the 
groupwide pooling of Telekom Security in our operating segment

PART-TIME EMPLOYEES DEUTSCHE TELEKOM GROUP
We believe it is important to offer our staff flexible working conditions 
that fit their needs at every stage of their lives. This includes the oppor-
tunity to work part-time, but also the guaranteed option of returning to 
work when the employee no longer wants to work part-time. We also 
offer this to young parents so that they can balance starting their career 
through training or a part-time cooperative study course with the 
demands of family life as a single parent. In 2017, 1,825 young people 
took the opportunity to do this. Part-time training is available in all of our 
training programs, and means apprentices spend 25 hours per week 
either in the company, in school, or in the training center. The highlight: 
like all apprentices, part-time apprentices can cut their training to two 
and a half years and therefore apply for a job earlier than would have 
otherwise been possible. A success model all round, since Deutsche 
Telekom also benefits from the young people's commitment.

The proportion of civil servants employed in the company fell once

In addition to civil servants leaving the company when they reach retire-
ment age, others also took advantage of early retirement or moved to 
other agencies. This led to a continuous drop in the number of civil

PORTFOLIO OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
275 patents were registered during the reporting period. By the end of 
2017, we owned around 8,300 intellectual property rights (IPRs), more 
than in the previous year. We take a targeted approach to managing 
these IPRs in consideration of cost-benefit aspects. We regularly take 
stock of our IPRs and eliminate those that are no longer relevant.
Patents are gaining more and more significance in the telecommunica-
tions industry. Market players and their areas of activity are changing, 
with a knock-on effect on our IPR (intellectual property rights) agenda. 
On the one hand, our Group's scope for action must be maintained. On 
the other hand and alongside our own research and development activi-
ties, we want to pave the way to open innovation through collaboration 
projects and partnerships. National and international IPRs are vital for 
these types of activity. We are strongly dedicated to generating our own 
property rights. Industrial property rights include inventions, patent 
applications, patents, utility models and design patents.
Thanks to our intense efforts to develop and structure our IPR portfolio, 
the rights we hold are highly valuable and firmly in line with our Group's 
strategic objectives. We have put in place a professional patent law 
management process to keep our IPR assets safe. Additionally, we are 
represented on various standardization bodies in our industry. We man-
age our IPRs on the basis of cost/benefit aspects, filing only selected 
applications and de-registering patents systematically.
